If it does, then the boulder would either stop or roll to the side, thus changing its path.  In the left image, we can see a possible path for the boulder to take.  However, that would separate the two edges.  Since the solution has to be connected, we know it cannot take this path!  Thus, we can update our possible paths for the boulder (blue background) by taking this into account."
