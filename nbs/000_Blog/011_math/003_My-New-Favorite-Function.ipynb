    "It's clear that this grows sub-exponentially, as $\\ln(x) < x$, but after some thought, it still wasn't clear to me that this would grow faster than a polynomial (based on intuition alone).  The related function $e^{\\ln(x)}$ grows linearly, so _a priori_ couldn't this one grow quadratically?  If the brackets were another way ($(e^{\\ln(x)})^2$) then it would.  A good rule of thumb for exponentials is that brackets starting from the right grow faster, so intuitively we can argue super-quadratic growth - but super-polynomial?  That needs more justification.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why it is super-polynomial, note the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{\\ln(x)^2} = e^{\\ln(x)\\ln(x)} = x^{\\ln(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So obviously the exponent of $\\ln(x)$ eventually surpasses any constant exponent $c$.  Didn't expect that, did you?  Well, maybe you did, but I didn't!"

    "I like this function for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) It's a cool example of what are called <b style=\"color:#EB1960\">Quasi-Polynomial Functions</b>, i.e. those of the form $\\exp(\\mathrm{polynomial}(\\log x))$, which as super-polynomial but sub-exponential.\n",
    "2) It shows why such functions, despite being sub-exponential, are intractable (in the algorithmic runtime sense).\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll elaborate on the second point.  When does our quasi-polynomial surpass a polynomial of degree $c$?  Well, $x^{\\ln(x)} > x^c \\iff \\ln(x) > 2 \\iff x > e^c$.  At first glance, this seems good - _it takes exponentially large $x$ to surpass a polynomial of fixed size_.  However, polynomials start becoming intractable in practice for a low value of $c$ - let's say $c=5$, since every time I've used an algorithm with a quintic runtime I've regretted it.  This just requires $x=149$ for our quasi-polynomial to surpass it, quite a low value!\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, it's clearly only \"on the edge of intractable\".  If we instead claimed $c=10$ was the limit of tractability, we are tractable until $x=22027$.  Its tractability is really only held back by the fact that polynomials become intractable at low exponents."

    "## My favorite function\n",
    "\n",
    "$e^{\\ln(x)^2}$ was very briefly my favorite function, but it is not currently my favorite function.  Rather, that is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^{\\ln\\ln(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's still super-polynomial/sub-exponential (and is also \"sub-quasi-polynomial\").  It is also quite tractable as far as runtimes go - a $c=5$ tractability cutoff only occurs when $x=e^{e^5} > 10^{64}$.  This is more than the number of atoms in the Earth ($\\sim 10^{50}$), so if you have to deal with a problem that large, you're already in trouble even with a linear-time algorithm.  You need a _doubly exponentially large_ input before things become intractable!\n",
    "\n",
    "That's certainly part of the reason why I like it; it is a \"natural technically intractable tractable function\" (which is a very fun phrase to say!).  However, there's another reason, which connects it with my childhood love of tetration:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^{\\ln\\ln(x)} = e^{\\ln(x)\\ln\\ln(x)} = \\ln(x)^{\\ln(x)} = \\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only is the identity $x^{\\ln\\ln(x)} = \\ln(x)^{\\ln(x)}$ pleasing, but its slow growth is quite surprising in light of its tetrational nature.  Intuitively, I'd have thought through the growth rate of $\\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 2$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) $x\\uparrow\\uparrow 2$ grows very very fast; it's the beginning stage of tetration, after all!\n",
    "2) $\\ln(x)$ grows exponentially slow, so $\\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 2$ will be slower than $x\\uparrow\\uparrow 2$, but still fast-growing (because tetration >> exponentiation, exponential slowness can't bring it down that much.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this intuition is wrong - the exponential slowness of $\\ln(x)$ is enough to bring it down to something effectively polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Both functions considered so far have been of the form $x^{\\ln^n(x)}$.  Technically, $x^{\\ln^n(x)}$ grows faster than any polynomial, but we've already seen that (when restricting to human scales) for $n\\geq 2$ it in practice does not.  If $n=3$, this function will not beat even a quadratic until about $x=10^{703}$.  In fact, it's easy to see that, as $n$ increases, the intractability threshold recedes away from us _tetrationally_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have the generalized identity, which is sadly only interesting for $n=2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^{\\ln^n(x)} = e^{\\ln(x)\\ln^n(x)} = \\left(\\ln^{n-1}(x)\\right)^{\\ln(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, any function $x^{f(x)} = e^{\\ln(x)f(x)}$, for unbounded $f$, is super-polynomial.  If $f(x) << \\frac{x}{\\ln(x)}$ then it will also be sub-exponential.  We saw that $x^{\\ln(x)}$ was close-to-tractable; if we want a definitively intractable sub-exponential function, all we need to consider is $x^{\\sqrt{x}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## One last word\n",
    "\n",
    "What about $\\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow n$ for some constant $n$?  This is much faster growing; for $n=3$, this passes our $c=5$ threshold when $x=15$.  As $n$ increases, we still get that extremely rapid tetrational growth.  It is no longer sub-exponential:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 3 > e^{\\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 2}\\text{ (for large enough }x\\text{)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we already established that $\\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 2$ grows super-polynomially, we must have that $\\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 3$ is super-exponential!"
