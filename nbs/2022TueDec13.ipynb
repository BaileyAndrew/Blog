    "Sam inspired me to make a blog, so here it is.  The goal of this blog is to document random problems I encounter over the course of the PhD, since often I end up encountering the same problem multiple times but forget how to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to make a blog\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem I encountered, albeit not a recurring one, is how to make a blog.  Sam made me aware of [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) but I wanted to find a Jupyter-based solution since I do (almost) all of my work in JupyterLab.  This led me to [`nbdev`](https://nbdev.fast.ai).  `nbdev` does many things, it seems, one of which is to allow you to compile `.ipynb` files into a blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting environments set up locally\n",
    "\n",
    "I then created two new conda environments, `Jupyter-nbdev` and `Blog-nbdev`: the first environment will be for the `nbdev`-empowered JupyterLab editor, and the second environment will be the specific kernel I'll use with the editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I'll have multiple environments open, as well as launching JupyterLab from a terminal and handling GitHub push/pulls to publish the blog, I created a terminal setup that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Customized Terminal](images/CustomizedTerminal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll share the commands I used to set this up, with a comment at the start indicating which terminal tab the commands should be run in.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# (Jupyter-nbdev)\n",
    "conda create -n Jupyter-nbdev\n",
    "conda activate Jupyter-nbdev\n",
    "\n",
    "conda install conda-forge::python=3.9 fastai::nbdev=2.3.9 conda-forge::jupyterlab=3.5.1 conda-forge::nb_conda_kernels=2.3.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose Python 3.9 because in the past bumping up to 3.10 has caused some packages to not be available.  I found the specific versions for other packages by running search commands and picking the most recent version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# (Jupyter-nbdev)\n",
    "conda search conda-forge::nbdev\n",
    "conda search fastai::nbdev\n",
    "conda search conda-forge::jupyterlab\n",
    "conda search conda-forge::nb_conda_kernels\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I would have preferred to install `nbdev` from `conda-forge` (since in the past I've had problems from mixing channels) but the only version available was a decent bit behind the `fastai` channel, and I'm early in the process so it wouldn't be a big deal if I needed to start over due to channel-mixing woes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# (Blog-nbdev)\n",
    "conda create -n Blog-nbdev\n",
    "conda activate Blog-nbdev\n",
    "conda install conda-forge::python=3.9 fastai::nbdev=2.3.9 conda-forge::ipykernel=6.19.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`ipykernel` and `nb_conda_kernels` are used to allow the `Jupyter-nbdev` JupyterLab to find the `Blog-nbdev` kernel.  From there, I launched JupyterLab:\n",

    "### Creating the GitHub repo\n",
    "\n",
    "I followed the steps [here](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html#first-steps).  In short: create a new public repository with no ReadMe or other file, but with the 'description' field filled in.  Then, go to the directory that you want to create your repo in in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# (GitHub)\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/NAME_OF_YOUR_REPO.git\n",
    "cd NAME_OF_YOUR_REPO\n",
    "nbdev_new\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last command tells `nbdev` to fill out the repository with the template for your blog.  I got the following output from `nbdev_new`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Output of (GitHub)\n",

    "! [remote rejected] main -> main (refusing to allow a Personal Access Token to create or update workflow .github/workflows/deploy.yaml without workflow scope)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The push command fails; the error message seems related to the warning I got previously.  The problem seems to be that I only ever create GitHub tokens with 'repo' permissions, not 'workflow' permissions, but `nbdev` uses the workflow feature to prepare the website.  This is easy to fix: on GitHub, click on your profile and go to 'settings', then 'developer settings', 'personal access tokens', and finally 'tokens (classic)'.  You can either create a new token, or update an existing one - just make sure to add the 'workflow' permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've pushed, go into settings on GitHub to set the branch to be `gh-pages`: ![fix](./images/SetupPages.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, run the following to allow `nbdev` to trigger workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# (GitHub)\n",
    "nbdev_install_hooks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, whenever you push to `main`, a workflow will automatically trigger that will generate the html/css/js for your website and put it in the `gh-pages` branch.  (I do not know if pushing to other branches would trigger this as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing a blog post\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're ready to start writing blog posts, go into the `nbs` folder and create a new `.ipynb` with the kernel `Python [conda env:Blog-nbdev]`.  (If it's not in the `nbs` folder, it won't appear in the blog).  There are already two examples, `index.ipynb` and `00_core.ipynb` - `index.ipynb` probably fills some special role so don't mess with it, but you can delete `00_core.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, your first cell should be a markdown cell with just a top-level header:\n",

    "# Top-level header\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the header will be the name of the blog post in the generated website (and the name of the file will be the name of the url to that post).  If you have anything else in the first cell, it will probably be cut off.  Your blog will likely look something like this initially:"
