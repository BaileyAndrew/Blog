    "It's not difficult, but hella annoying, to work out that there are 12.  This corresponds to the following [OEIS sequence](https://oeis.org/A264603).  Ignoring the grid restrictions sudoku is just a \"Latin Square\" puzzle; fit the numbers 1 to n in an nxn square without having the same number twice in a column/row.  There are many possible 4x4 latin squares (576, to be precise).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it doesn't really feel like rotating a latin square by 90¬∞ should produce a new latin square - the two squares are still essentially the same.  More precisely, we want to account for symmetry.  There are 4 types of symmetries that a latin square can have:\n",

    "   *  It might feel like there are more, depending on your axis of reflection - but we can account for this using the rotations, so we really only need one axis of reflection\n",
    "3) <b style=\"color:#EB1960\">Permutational</b> (24 different types)\n",
    "   *  We could easily swap every occurance of 1 with 2 and vice versa, but the square is still \"the same\".  This is permutational symmetry, in which we change which numbers are which but not where they are.\n",
    "   *  (24 = 4!)\n",
    "4) <b style=\"color:#EB1960\">Row-permutational</b> (24 different types)\n",
    "   *  We can change the order of the rows without changing the latin square\n",
    "   *  Column permutations can be done using a rotation first\n",
    "   \n",
    "The first three symmetries all still apply when we add a grid, but the fourth one could destroy our grid by splitting one of our boxes into two disconnected components.  Typically we don't allow this, so I'm treating puzzles that are row-permutationally equivalent to be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that there are only 4 different latin squares, accounting for all 4 symmetries - but when we ignore row-permutational symmetries, there are 12 different latin squares.  To my knowledge, these are not enumerated anywhere on the internet.\n",

The question of how many grids there are can be rephrased as \"how many ways can a 4x4 square be decomposed into tetrominos\"?  For this, I refer the reader to [the mayhematics site](https://www.mayhematics.com/d/d4.htm) which has a nice writeup.  These are the grids:\n",
