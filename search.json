In this post, we’ll look at what it means to be convex, and why we should care.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))\nax.plot(np.linspace(-5, 5, 100), np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)**2)\nax.set_title(\"$x^2$ - a convex function\")\npass\nA convex function is a function (of potentially multiple variables) with the following property: any line drawn between two points on the function will never pass below the function. Note that this forces the function to have a single local mimimum1 - think about it!2. If you consider the shape formed by all the points above the function, you will have a convex shape - hence the name."

Note, however that all minima are just as good as any other.↩︎\nAnother aside; the convex function \\(e^x\\) has no minima, unless we count the minimum at \\(-\\infty\\). The real benefit is that we no longer have to worry about getting stuck in suboptimal local mimima.↩︎"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In JupyterLab, we can collapse all cells underneath a header, which can be useful for hiding extraneous info. However, when we render it in Quarto the collapsability is not preserved. It would be nice if we could recreate this feature!\nQuarto does offer some methods for collapsing:\n\n\n The first is &lt;details&gt; html blocks. \n\nThese are my preferred method because it is pure html and thus highly customizable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipThe second is a Quarto-specific collapsable callout block\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich I don’t use because it’s not pure html, and thus doesn’t render in the notebook - it only appears after rendering with Quarto.\n\n\n\nThe quarto method has the benefit that it can be split over multiple cells, allowing the collapsing of code cells:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipYou can see that it still works!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprint(\"It worked!\")\n\n[1] \"It worked!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessing around with Quarto\n\nThere’s a major problem, though; the Quarto method looks a little too professional… I want the callout blocks to have the same appearance as a &lt;details&gt; tag!\nThe first step we can do is add a class to our callout block:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\nThe markdown to generate is:\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" #custom-callout}\n  &lt;h2&gt;Test&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;! -- ETC... --&gt;\n:::\n\n\n\nTo make that work, I used a fairly advanced bit of CSS:\nFirst, create a file blocks.css, into which you’ll put the style, and then add this to the Quarto header:\nformat:\n  html:\n    css: blocks.css\nFill the css file with the following:\n.callout-tip #custom-callout :is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) {\n  color:#C0CF96\n}\nThis says “for all objects with the callout-tip class and the custom-callout id, check if any of their children are h1 or h2 or (…) or h6. If so, give them this specific color.”\nIt’s not perfect, though - as the header (“Test”) no longer shows up on the title but rather only appears when you open the drop-down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTest\n\n\n\n\n\nThe markdown to generate is:\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" #custom-callout2}\n  ## Test\n  &lt;! -- ETC... --&gt;\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can start poking around with inspect element to get the classes we need to mess with in the CSS:\n#custom-callout2 div.callout-caption-container.flex-fill {\n  color:#C0CF96;\n  font-weight:bold;\n}\n#custom-callout2 div.callout-icon-container {\n  opacity:0%;\n}\nAll that’s left is to remove the pesky background:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTest\n\n\n\n\n\nThe markdown to generate is:\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" #clean-collapse}\n  ## ▶ Test\n  &lt;! -- ETC... --&gt;\n:::\n\nprint(\"Running code just to demonstrate it still works\")\n\n[1] \"Running code just to demonstrate it still works\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI added the following CSS:\n#clean-collapse div.callout-caption-container.flex-fill {\n  color:#C0CF96;\n  font-weight:bold;\n}\n\n#clean-collapse div.callout-icon-container {\n  opacity:0%;\n}\nAnd to get rid of the background I had to remove the callout-style-default class using JavaScript:\n&lt;script&gt;\n  element = document.getElementById(\"clean-collapse\");\n  element.classList.remove(\"callout-style-default\");\n&lt;/script&gt;\nWhich can just be put anywhere on the page - probably it will make sense to make a .js file that will contain all of these scripts, such as this and the comments scripts, and paste them on each page.\nHowever, the fatal flaw with this method - that can only ever edit one dropdown at once, and it requires you to manually add arrows. To fix this, we can do more sophistic JavaScript:\n&lt;script&gt;\n    // Remove background\n    elements = document.querySelectorAll('[id=clean-collapse]').forEach(\n        function(element) {\n            element.classList.remove(\"callout-style-default\");\n        }\n    )\n    \n    // Add arrow to front to signify dropdownyness\n    arrow = \"▶\";\n    elements = document.querySelectorAll('.callout-caption-container').forEach(\n        function(element) {\n            element.innerHTML = arrow + element.innerHTML;\n        }\n    )\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nI took this opportunity to refactor the website, so that I don’t need to put comments, css, and javascript at the end of every webpage, rather I can do it by including premade files, like so:\n---\ntitle: \"Collapsable Multi-Cell Blocks in Quarto Output of .ipynb\"\ndescription: \"Surprisingly easy!\"\nauthor: \"Bailey Andrew\"\ndate: \"Jan 9 2023\"\ndraft: false\ncategories: [Work, Useful]\nformat:\n  html:\n    css:\n      - ../../html_scripts/collapse.css\n      - ../../html_scripts/pretty_shortcuts.css\n    include-after-body: \n      - ../../html_scripts/collapse.html\n      - ../../html_scripts/comments.html\n---\n\n\n\n\nBut in fact you don’t need to mess around with the Quarto way, because the &lt;details&gt; tag works multi-line as well - that’s how I hid all the “playing around with quarto” stuff."

    "section": "",
    "text": "from dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Callable, Optional, Tuple\nimport random\nGrowing up, I played a lot of Zoombinis. Zoombinis is well-known for teaching maths, but I think most people talk more about the “high-concept” maths that it teaches, i.e. set theory. I haven’t seen much discussion on the algorithmics that it teaches.\nThe topic of this blog post is the first level of Zoombinis. In it, you have a set of Zoombinis and two paths (cliffs) in front of you. Each Zoombini can travel across exactly one path - but you don’t know which one until you try it! Which path they can traverse is based on the features of the Zoombinis - on the easiest difficulty, one of the cliffs is “allergic” to Zoombinis with exactly one type of trait, and the other is allergic to all other Zoombinis.\nWe can talk about how it is teaching basic set theory (complements and unions - depending on difficulty level), but that does not interest me that much. Rather, I’m interested in how to efficiently solve the level. There are multiple ways to define efficiency:\nSince the problem size for Zoombinis is fixed (at most 16 Zoombinis per level), considering asymptotic complexity is not of much interest to me currently. Also, I’m most interested in algorithms humans would actually implement, in which case the time sink is the number of input and output queries."

    "text": "“Compositional data” is data representing the composition of something - i.e. water is 66% H and 33% O (H20) by atom count, so a glass of water could be described as the compositional vector [2/3 1/3] regardless of how big the glass is. It’s scale-independent; it should always sum to one.\nThe space that compositional data lives in is called the Simplex. “Simplex” is a fancy name for an arbitrarily-dimensional triangle. Just like how we can imagine the set of vectors with magnitude one as existing on a hypersphere (arbitrarily-dimensional sphere), the set of vectors with sum one exists on a (hyper)triangle with vertices along each of the axes - hence the name “simplex”. This is in contrast with ordinary data, which lives in Euclidean space.\nEuclidean space is “normal” space; your intuitions about geometric facts are likely to be valid here. However, the Simplex is a different space with different rules. If we do not account for those rules when performing analyses, our results will be erroneous.\nIf you don’t like the line on the left being “straight”, call it a geodesic; it means the same thing but you probably don’t have any preconceived notions as to its meaning. Note that this is the same reason that long haul planes don’t travel on “straight” lines on the map; the plane is travelling on a straight line (geodesic) in the natural geometry of the earth’s surface (the curvature). A geodesic is the shortest path1 between two points. The Simplex is graphed as a triangle because of its, well, triangular nature - note that it actually has three axes, one for each side. It may have three parameters, but the dimensionality of the data is 2. In arbitrary dimensions, you may have \\(n\\) numbers, but the last number can always be worked out by 1 minus the sum of the others."

    "text": "Log-Ratio Transforms\nTake the set of variables \\(\\{\\forall i : x_i\\}\\) in your compositional data. The set of log-ratios would be \\(\\{\\forall i, j : \\log \\frac{x_i}{x_j}\\}\\). Since compositional data is all about relative sizes, it does make intuitive sense why ratios would be important. There are three major log-ratio transforms (CLR, ALR, ILR): they all depend on picking out a particularly nice, small, subset of these log-ratios (or log-ratio-ish things). They’re particularly natural when you have reason to believe your data is close to being log-normally distributed.\n\nCentered Log-Ratio (CLR)\nCLR is an isometry - it is a reversible mapping from the Simplex to Euclidean space which perfectly preserves the geometric structure. In other words, it gives us a way of interpreting the Simplex in terms of our pre-existing Euclidean intuitions. While transformations being an isometry does not necessarily make it the right tool for the job, the fact that this is an isometry points to it being a mathematically “natural” thing to do. Mathematics often rewards naturality.\nCLR preserves the amount of parameters of the data. The parameters preserve their meaning: the \\(i\\)th parameter pre- and post-CLR still represent a measure of size for the same thingamajig (somewhat like, but different to, measuring things in miles vs kilometers).\nIts downside is that it preserves the number of parameters. As we saw, data in the Simplex requires more parameters than its dimensionality - this is still true in the output of CLR as it does not remove parameters.\nAs an aside, the inverse function of CLR is Softmax.\n\n\nAdditive Log-Ratio (ALR)\nALR is not an isometry, it is usually close enough to being one (Greenacre et al. 2022) that the difference does not matter too much. Unlike CLR, ALR reduces the amount of parameters of your data to match its dimensionality. It does this by picking one of your original parameters to be the reference; it will be the denominator in all the log-ratios. Hence the log-ratio associated with the reference will always be 0 and can be ignored. This is, of course, a downside if all of the potential references are interesting in their own right, as one will have to be sacrificed.\nThis is my personal favorite of the log-ratio transforms; even though I am a mathematician, I think approximate equality is just as good as exact equality in the real world. I don’t need my transform to be an exact isometry.\n\n\nSidequest: How to choose a good reference for ALR\n\nI couldn’t find anything online 🤷‍♂️ I assume it’s best to just pick the least interesting parameter. For what I do, there are many uninteresting parameters so this should not be a problem. If we chose a constant parameter \\(1\\), then I guess this would be equivalent to just taking the log transform.\n\n\n\nIsometric Log-Ratio (ILR)\nILR is an isometry, and it also reduces the parameterspace to match the dimensionality. It does this at the cost of interpretability; while there is some kind of interpretation based on the concept of “balances”2, the parameters post-ILR are not directly related to those pre-ILR. This is my least favorite of the log-ratio transforms; it is mathematically interesting, but at least in the work that I’ve been doing lately I very much want the parameters pre-ILR and post-ILR to have obvious and immediate relationships."

    "text": "How to make a Slitherlink level generator\nSlitherlink is a fun logic puzzle played on a grid; a good website to try it is Krazydad, or if you have a tablet I would recommend the Slitherlink app by Conceptis.\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nAbove is an in-progress example of a Slitherlink puzzle.\nIt has the following rules:\n\nIf there is a number X in a cell, there must be exactly X filled-in edges around the number.\nAll the filled-in edges in a puzzle must join together to form a single continuous loop.\n\nA good Slitherlink puzzle comes with the guarantee that there is a unique solution. The above example has the solution:\n\n\n\nSolved Example\n\n\nFrom the perspective of a Slitherlink generator, every puzzle has two components:\n\nThe solution\nThe hints\n\nGiven a solution, it is trivial to fill the grid with maximal hints - some process could be used to then remove hints iteratively to increase the difficulty of the puzzle, if desired.\nEven without such a process we would still have a valid, if easy, Slitherlink puzzle; thus we should focus on generating a solution first. Instead of trying to generate the loop itself, we can think of the loop as being the boundary between some shape and the outside of the grid.\nAs a first attempt, we will just generate a completely random ‘shape’. It will probably be disconnected and hence an invalid solution; this is just temporary to test the puzzle rendering.\nconda install conda-forge::numpy=1.23.5\nconda install conda-forge::matplotlib=3.6.2\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\ndef random_slitherlink(\n    shape: \"Two element tuple\"\n) -&gt; \"0/1 numpy array with shape `shape`\":\n    return np.random.randint(0, 2, shape)\nslither = random_slitherlink((7, 7))\nslither\n\narray([[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n       [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n       [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n       [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n       [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n       [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n       [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]])\n\n\n\ndef display_slitherlink_solution(\n    grid: \"0/1 numpy array\"\n) -&gt; \"(fig, ax) tuple for plotted figure\":\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))\n    ax.imshow(grid)\n    return (fig, ax)\ndisplay_slitherlink_solution(slither)\npass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a good solution turns out to be a bit difficult, and I made some false starts. Sam had the good idea of including false pathways in his blog as expandable dropdowns, which I will steal. This way, people can still follow my thought process if desired, but false pathways do not distract from the flow of the true solution.\n\n\nAttempt 1: Painting lines\n\nMy first idea was to choose a random cell, and draw a straight line at a random distance from it. Then, iteratively pick a random inside cell and create a new straight line (making sure to never intersect with an already created line).\nI didn’t quite finish the code for it (still some bugs - it’s possible for it to cut the outside into multiple parts diagonally), but I abandoned the path because I wasn’t happy with it - I had the idea for my next attempt, based on surface area, since I think it would be more elegant.\ndef random_slitherlink(\n    shape: \"Two element tuple\",\n    iters: int = 5\n) -&gt; \"Boolean numpy array with shape `shape`\":\n    # Initialize\n    slither = np.zeros(shape).astype(bool)\n    \n    # Maybe transpose it\n    transposed = np.random.randint(2)\n    if transposed:\n        slither = slither.T\n    \n    # Pick a random column to slither from\n    slither[\n        :np.random.randint(1, slither.shape[0]),\n        np.random.randint(slither.shape[1])\n    ] = True\n    \n    # Maybe flip it\n    if np.random.randint(2):\n        slither = slither[::-1]\n    \n    # Un-transpose it to preserve shape\n    if transposed:\n        slither = slither.T\n    \n    # Iteratively add slithers\n    for i in range(iters):\n        \n        # Choose cell to expand\n        choice = (\n            np.random.choice(\n                np.argwhere(slither.reshape(-1))[:, 0]\n            )\n        )\n        row = choice // shape[1]\n        col = choice % shape[1]\n        \n        # Always expand in the direction with the most space\n        column_slithers = np.argwhere(slither[row]).reshape(-1) - col\n        row_slithers = np.argwhere(slither[:, col]).reshape(-1) - row\n        column_slithers = column_slithers[column_slithers != 0]\n        row_slithers = row_slithers[row_slithers != 0]\n        \n        along_columns = True\n        \n        \n        # Find the direction with the largest possible extension\n        if len(row_slithers) == 0:\n            row_slithers = np.array([0, shape[0]]) - row\n        if len(column_slithers) == 0:\n            column_slithers = np.array([0, shape[1]]) - col\n        if np.abs(row_slithers).min() &lt; np.abs(column_slithers).min():\n            # More room to expand along columns\n            along_columns = True\n        else:\n            along_columns = False\n        \n        # Flip the solution if along columns\n        if along_columns:\n            slither = slither.T\n            row_slithers = column_slithers\n            temp = row\n            row = col\n            col = temp\n            \n        # Left or right\n        # Check if smallest-in-magnitude negative number\n        # is larger than smallest-in-magnitude positive number\n        # and if so, go left\n        left = np.random.randint(0, 2) == 0\n        if len(row_slithers) &gt; 0:\n            neg_sliths = -row_slithers[row_slithers &lt;= 0]\n            pos_sliths = row_slithers[row_slithers &gt;= 0]\n            \n            if len(neg_sliths) &gt; 0:\n                max_left = neg_sliths.min()\n            else:\n                max_left = 0\n                \n            if len(pos_sliths) &gt; 0:\n                max_right = pos_sliths.min()\n            else:\n                max_right = 0\n                \n            if (max_left &gt; max_right):\n                left = True\n            else:\n                left = False\n        else:\n            if along_columns:\n                slither = slither.T\n            continue\n                \n        max_slither = max_left if left else max_right\n        \n        offset = np.random.randint(0, max_slither)\n        if left:\n            slither[row:row-offset, col] = True\n        else:\n            slither[row:row+offset, col] = True\n            \n        # Reset the flipped solution\n        if along_columns:\n            slither = slither.T\n        \n        \n        \n    \n    return slither\ndisplay_slitherlink_solution(\n    random_slitherlink((7, 10), iters=100)\n)\npass\n\nMy next idea was based on circumference - large slitherlinks look very crumpled, and so intuitively they should have a large circumference compared to their area. Imagine the following process:\n\nStart with the entire grid enclosed in one loop\nPick a random cell to ‘fold’ inwards\n\nOnly pick cells that can be folded without creating two loops\nWeight the random pick by cells that add the most edges\n\nStop when we reach a prespecificed circumference-to-area ratio\n\nThis should, hopefully, produce random crumpled loops.\nTo elaborate on “only pick cells that won’t create two loops”, there are two scenarios we need to avoid:\n |1|        |1|_\n |x|        |x 1\n |1|        |1|‾\nIn neither scenario can we fold in the x - in the first, it cuts the loop in two, and in the second, it results in four edges at a corner:\n|1̲|_\n x̲|1̲\n|1|\nThe procedure I’ve described is conceptually simple, but it took quite a lot of code to implement 😅 There’re probably more elegant ways to program it\n\ndef get_neighbors(ck, shape):\n    neighbors = [\n        (ck[0], ck[1]-1),\n        (ck[0], ck[1]+1),\n        (ck[0]-1, ck[1]),\n        (ck[0]+1, ck[1])\n    ]\n    neighbors = [\n        neighbor for neighbor in neighbors\n        if neighbor[0] &gt;= 0\n        and neighbor[0] &lt;

    "title": "What is 16s rRNA?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "16s rRNA sequencing is a type of sequencing that specifically targets the 16s rRNA gene. It is frequently used for metagenomics - the sequencing of genetic material directly from an environment (such as sea water or the gut microbiome via stool samples) rather than the sequencing of genes from a specific organism. rRNA stands for “ribosomal RNA”.\nRibosomes are the bits inside the cell that convert mRNA into proteins. It is made up of rRNA and (chicken-and-egg-ily) proteins. Names have been given to the different bits of rRNA in a ribosome. 16s rRNA is the name for one of the parts, specifically in prokaryotic species.\n16s rRNA sequencing targets the gene that codes for 16s rRNA, because it tends to evolve slowly - thus it can act as a fingerprint for different species, allowing us to get an overview of the prokaryotic species in a sample.\n\nHow is 16s rRNA sequencing done?\n\nWe use the high-fidelity Phusion polymerase for amplification of 16s and ITS2 marker genes. If extractions contain some carry-over inhibition or a high concentration of DNA, typically we test 1:1 and 1:10 dilutions and run the PCR products on gels for verification. PCR is done with dual-barcoded primers (Kozich et al. 2014) targeting either the prokaryotic (16S V4, V1-V3) or fungal (ITS2) regions. Our barcoding strategy enables multiplexing up to 384 samples per run. PCR products are verified visually by running a representative subset of samples on a gel. Samples with failed PCRs (or spurious bands) are re-amplified by optimizing PCR conditions. The PCR reactions are cleaned up and normalized using the high-throughput SequalPrep 96-well Plate Kit. Samples are then pooled to make one library that is quantified accurately with the KAPA qPCR Library Quant kit.\n– 16S rRNA Sequencing Service page; Library Preparation Section, Microbiome Insights\n\nA polymerase is a molecule that can create new strands of DNA/RNA (so its no wonder that it is used for amplification). Notably, polymerase is the “P” in PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). Primers are used to encourage amplification of only the 16s rRNA gene (we can ignore the bit about the ITS2 gene as they are talking about fungi there).\n\nThe 16S rRNA gene is approximately 1600 base pairs long and includes nine hypervariable regions of varying conservation (V1-V9). More conservative regions are useful for determining the higher-ranking taxa, whereas more quickly evolving ones can help identify genus or species.\nBukin et al.

The OSCA book makes the following plot:\n\ngene.var.data &lt;- modelGeneVar(sce)\nmd &lt;- metadata(gene.var.data)\nmd.as.df &lt;- data.frame(mean=md$mean, var=md$var)\n\n\nggplot(md.as.df, aes(mean, var)) +\n    geom_point(shape=2) +\n    geom_line(\n        aes(mean, md$trend(mean), lty='Variance Trend'),\n        color=\"blue\",\n        linewidth=2,\n    ) +\n    labs(\n        x=\"Mean of Log-Counts\",\n        y=\"Variance of Log-Counts\"\n    ) +\n    ggtitle(\"Mean-Variance Plot of Log-Counts\") +\n    scale_linetype(\"\") # This changes the legend title for some reason\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot is showing the mean-variance trend of the logs. The trend is assumed to be the ‘uninteresting variation’, i.e. the baseline variation of the experiment (assumed to be the technical variation and the ‘boring’ biological variation). Under this assumption, the deviation from this trend represents the interesting biological variation.\nBut speaking of mean-variance trends, this reminds me of the fact that Poisson distributions have equal mean and variance; it’s reasonable to believe that our original (non-log) counts follow a Poisson distribution: is this correct?\n\nmeans &lt;- rowMeans(assay(sce, \"counts\"))\nvars &lt;- rowVars(assay(sce, \"counts\"))\n\nggplot(\n    data.frame(\n        means=means,\n        vars=vars\n    ),\n    aes(\n        x=means,\n        y=vars\n    )\n) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_abline(slope=1, color='blue')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, this is not accurate at all! The variance is way higher than the means. This could be because the counts have already been scaled by a value. I’ll have a think about this for the future. I did discover the modelGeneVarByPoisson function, so let’s see what that does:\n\ngene.var.data &lt;- modelGeneVarByPoisson(sce)\nmd &lt;- metadata(gene.var.data)\nmd.as.df &lt;- data.frame(mean=md$mean, var=md$var)\n\n\nggplot(md.as.df, aes(mean, var)) +\n    geom_point(shape=2) +\n    geom_line(\n        aes(mean, md$trend(mean), lty='Variance Trend'),\n        color=\"blue\",\n        linewidth=1,\n    ) +\n    labs(\n        x=\"Mean of Log-Counts\",\n        y=\"Variance of Log-Counts\"\n    ) +\n    ggtitle(\"Mean-Variance Plot of Log-Counts Poissonly\") +\n    scale_linetype(\"\") # This changes the legend title for some reason\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly enough, this looks very accurate! So it’s plausible that I messed up somewhere in my prior plot. Of course, I don’t really understand what this plot represents at the moment - but it’s clear the predicted trend deviates somewhat from the true trend at the maximum (it oversetimates it).\nFor completeness, let’s peek at the most varying genes!\n\ngenes.by.variance &lt;- gene.var.data[order(gene.var.data$bio, decreasing=TRUE),]\nhead(genes.by.variance)\n\nDataFrame with 6 rows and 6 columns\n                        mean     total      tech       bio      p.value\n                   &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt;    &lt;numeric&gt;\nENSGALG00000037167  1.554552   2.50414  0.848294  1.655847 3.16059e-154\nENSGALG00000035998  3.027209   2.17292  0.525832  1.647090  0.00000e+00\nENSGALG00000046616  0.717956   2.08196  0.619730  1.462226 3.02326e-224\nENSGALG00000010745  1.929346   2.16633  0.816513  1.349819 2.86377e-111\nENSGALG00000052192  2.813587   1.65282  0.577865  1.074959 2.77975e-140\nENSGALG00000015970  0.590967   1.49926  0.542383  0.956873 2.09606e-126\n                            FDR\n                      &lt;numeric&gt;\nENSGALG00000037167 8.62525e-151\nENSGALG00000035998  0.00000e+00\nENSGALG00000046616 1.03131e-220\nENSGALG00000010745 2.60508e-108\nENSGALG00000052192 5.41853e-137\nENSGALG00000015970 3.17786e-123\n\n\n\nrowData(sce[rownames(sce) == \"ENSGALG00000037167\"])$hgnc_symbol\nrowData(sce[rownames(sce) == \"ENSGALG00000035998\"])$hgnc_symbol\nrowData(sce[rownames(sce) == \"ENSGALG00000046616\"])$hgnc_symbol\nrowData(sce[rownames(sce) == \"ENSGALG00000010745\"])$hgnc_symbol\nrowData(sce[rownames(sce) == \"ENSGALG00000052192\"])$hgnc_symbol\nrowData(sce[rownames(sce) == \"ENSGALG00000015970\"])$hgnc_symbol\n\n''\n\n\n''\n\n\n'CHGB'\n\n\n''\n\n\n'TUBA1B'\n\n\n''\n\n\nMost of these aren’t named, annoyingly - which made me realize that the H in “HGNC” stands for “human” 😅\nIf we use other sources, such as bgee, we can get a bit more info.\n\nBgee is a database for retrieval and comparison of gene expression patterns across multiple animal species.

    "text": "This post follows on from the previous one. In the last post, we recreated a graph (a network of microbial associations) in the paper with moderate success. In the paper (Vincent Prost (2021)), they then add a numerical measure to this network to understand the extent to which it is feasible network. Specifically, they measure the assortativity of the graph. Assortativity is a measure of how much vertices of the same group tend to be connected to eachother - in this case, the paper groups vertices by taxonomy1.\nThey computed assortativity at three different taxonomic levels, with the values being given in Table S1:\nThe network is stored as an igraph object adjacency.graph, calculated in the code hidden by the dropdown.\nadjacency.graph\n\nIGRAPH 36c88f2 U--- 565 1200 -- \n+ edges from 36c88f2:\n [1]  1--  2  1-- 76  2-- 77  2--195  3--324  4--528  5--221  5--479  5--480\n[10]  5--526  5--534  5--542  5--553  5--563  7--244  7--261  7--299  7--479\n[19]  7--485  7--526  8--  9  8-- 66  8-- 69  8-- 85  8--153  8--234  8--246\n[28]  9-- 66  9-- 67  9-- 68  9-- 69  9--128  9--130  9--211 10-- 67 10--128\n[37] 11-- 82 11--120 11--243 11--290 11--336 11--363 11--435 11--437 11--456\n[46] 11--457 12--542 13-- 53 13-- 76 13--192 13--272 13--326 14--106 14--244\n[55] 14--254 14--342 14--554 15-- 34 15-- 46 15--243 15--337 16-- 17 16--316\n[64] 16--451 16--458 16--510 16--519 17-- 64 17--316 17--343 17--510 17--525\n[73] 19-- 20 19-- 21 19-- 25 19-- 30 19-- 32 19-- 34 19-- 35 19-- 54 19-- 81\n+ ... omitted several edges\nEvaluating the assortativity of a graph is straightforward with the igraph package:\nget.assortativity.at.level &lt;- function(adjacency.graph, taxmat, taxa.level) {\n    groups &lt;- as.integer(as.factor(taxmat[, taxa.level]))\n    return(assortativity(adjacency.graph, groups))\n}\n\nget.assortativity.at.levels &lt;- function(adjacency.graph, taxmat) {\n    curried.assortativity &lt;- function(taxa.level) get.assortativity.at.level(\n        adjacency.graph,\n        taxmat,\n        taxa.level\n    )\n    return(\n        lapply(\n            colnames(taxmat),\n            curried.assortativity\n        )[2:length(colnames(taxmat))]\n    )        \n}\n\nprint.assortativity.performances &lt;- function(adjacency.graph, taxmat) {\n    for (taxa.level in colnames(taxmat)) {\n        if (taxa.level == \"Domain\") {\n            # Skip b/c everything in dataset has domain being bacteria\n            # which will cause this to evaluate as NaN.\n            next()\n        }\n        print(\n            paste(\n                taxa.level,\n                \": \",\n                get.assortativity.at.level(adjacency.graph, taxmat_el, taxa.level)\n            )\n        )\n    }\n}\nprint.assortativity.performances(adjacency.graph, taxmat_el)\n\n[1] \"Phylum :  0.119028213625117\"\n[1] \"Class :  0.114678278712612\"\n[1] \"Order :  0.00101704475751504\"\n[1] \"Family :  0.0227129118376968\"\n[1] \"Genus :  0.0295176588068461\"\nIt seems that the assortativity for order is much lower than the rest, although the lower-taxa levels are all much lower than the high-taxa levels. This would be expected as it is easier to accurately group things in a few larger groups than many smaller groups.\nUnfortunately for us, this is very far away from the expected results. We know from the last post that we had a lot more isolated vertices than in the paper, so maybe we should look at assortativity as a function of the regularization parameter.\nlambdas &lt;- 10^seq(0, -2, by=-0.1)\nprecision.matrix.path &lt;- huge(zs, lambda = lambdas)$path\n\nConducting Meinshausen & Buhlmann graph estimation (mb)....done\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(\"scales\")\nsparsities &lt;- sapply(precision.matrix.path, sum) / 2\nggplot(data.frame(sparsities), aes(lambdas, sparsities)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    scale_x_continuous(\n        trans = \"log10\",\n        breaks = round(\n            lambdas[seq(1, length(lambdas), 4)],\n            digits = 3\n        )\n    ) +\n    ggtitle(\"Number of edges in graph as sparsity increases\") +\n    labs(x = \"Regularization parameter lambda\", y = \"Number of edges\")\nplot.all.assortativities &lt;- function(path, taxmat, lambdas) {\n    graphs &lt;- lapply(\n        lapply(path, graph.adjacency),\n        as.undirected\n    )\n    assortativities &lt;- lapply(\n        graphs,\n        function(graph) get.assortativity.at.levels(graph, taxmat)\n    )\n\n    # Remove first element as full of NaNs\n    assortativities &lt;- assortativities[2:length(assortativities)]\n    lambdas.short &lt;- lambdas[2:length(lambdas)]\n    \n    assortativities.1 &lt;- as.numeric(lapply(assortativities, function(l) l[[1]]))\n    assortativities.2 &lt;- as.numeric(lapply(assortativities, function(l) l[[2]]))\n    assortativities.3 &lt;- as.numeric(lapply(assortativities, function(l) l[[3]]))\n    assortativities.4 &lt;- as.numeric(lapply(assortativities, function(l) l[[4]]))\n    assortativities.5 &lt;- as.numeric(lapply(assortativities, function(l) l[[5]]))\n    ggplot(\n        data.frame(assortativities.1),\n        aes(x=lambdas.short)\n    ) +\n        geom_line(aes(y = assortativities.1, color = \"Phylum\")) +\n        geom_line(aes(y = assortativities.2, color = \"Class\")) +\n        geom_line(aes(y = assortativities.3, color = \"Order\")) +\n        geom_line(aes(y = assortativities.4, color = \"Family\")) +\n        geom_line(aes(y = assortativities.5, color = \"Genus\")) +\n        scale_colour_manual(\"\", \n            breaks = c(\"Phylum\", \"Class\", \"Order\", \"Family\", \"Genus\"),\n            values = c(\"black\", \"blue\", \"maroon\", \"red\", \"orange\")\n        ) +\n        theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n        labs(x = \"Regularization parameter lambda\", y = \"Assortativities\") +\n        ggtitle(\"Assortativities at different taxonomic levels\")\n}\nplot.all.assortativities(precision.matrix.path, taxmat_el, lambdas)\nInterestingly, at no point do we reproduce the assortativities seen in the paper. This is easily seen because order never reaches \\(0.10\\), the value that is reported by Vincent Prost (2021). Now, this may be because we’re calculating the precision matrix using the Meinshausen and Buhlmann graph estimation method, the default in igraph. Perhaps we would have better luck using the Graphical LASSO method? We know that Vincent Prost (2021) use Meinshausen and Buhlmann for their Figure 5 data, but they do not report their method for Figure 4 - the figure we’re interested in - so it is reasonable to assume that they may have used Graphical LASSO here (a method also used elsewhere in their paper).\nlambdas.glasso &lt;- 10^seq(0, -2, by=-0.1)\nglasso.path &lt;- huge(zs, lambda = lambdas.glasso, method=\"glasso\")$path\n\nConducting the graphical lasso (glasso) wtih lossless screening....in progress: 95%\nConducting the graphical lasso (glasso)....done.\nsparsities &lt;- sapply(glasso.path, sum) / 2\nggplot(data.frame(sparsities), aes(lambdas.glasso, sparsities)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    scale_x_continuous(\n        trans = \"log10\",\n        breaks = round(\n            lambdas.glasso[seq(1, length(lambdas.glasso), 4)],\n            digits = 3\n        )\n    ) +\n    ggtitle(\"Number of edges in graph as sparsity increases\") +\n    labs(x = \"Regularization parameter lambda\", y = \"Number of edges\")\nplot.all.assortativities(glasso.path, taxmat_el, lambdas.glasso)\nNo - glasso performs much notably worse!

Anyways, I have my own GLasso method, antGLasso, so I want to try it.

However, due to the extreme sparsity in those situations its not very useful. When looking at more reasonably sparsified situations, antGLasso does terrible. Not only does it not have substantial assortativity for the higher taxonomic levels, but the low-level taxonomies have negative assortativity.\nOnce again, a paper replication blog post ends on a bit of a downer, this time twofold:\nSuch is life."

    "section": "Experimental Design",
    "text": "Experimental Design\nBefore downloading the data, we want to check if it’s actually useful to us - is it mRNA, what type of cells are they, were specific genes targeted, etc. Since the previous blog posts were talking about the wetlab generation of the data, let’s do a deep dive into what they did. The paper (Hernández et al. 2018) is freely available online, and the pertinent information will be contained in the Materials and Methods section. The paper is the source of two datasets on the Single Cell Expression Atlas so we will have to keep that in mind when reading about the methods.\n\nSample Selection\n\nThe aim of this study was to characterised innate and adaptive lymphocytes in zebrafish in steady state and following the immune challenge, using scRNA-seq. Multiple zebrafish, either in steady state or exposed to immune challenge, were used to collect cells for sequencing.\n– Study Design Subsection; Materials and Methods Section; Hernández et al. (2018) \n\nA lymphocyte is a specific type of cell that is part of your immune system; B, T, and NK cells are all lymphocytes. We can also see that the experiment was done on multiple zebrafish, rather than just one - and that some were “exposed to immune challenge”, which I assume means they were made sick to try to trigger interesting processes in their immune system.\nThe paper goes into more depth into this immune challenge (it involves Vibrio anguillarum, a “fish pathogen” (details: Frans et al. 2011)), however this does not seem to be relevant for our dataset. The paper seems to refer to our dataset as the Smart-seq2 experiment, whereas the other dataset is the 10x experiment. The immune challenge was only applied to the 10x experiment. We can double-check this by comparing the sample characteristics of our dataset and the other dataset on the Single Cell Expression Atlas, noting that infect is not one of the experimental variables for our dataset.\nA triple-check, if the above was not convincing enough2, can be found when we read the whole paper:\n\nTo allow easy retrieval of sequencing data from zebrafish innate and adaptive lymphocytes we generated a cloud repository (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/lymphocytes/ lymphocytes/) with transcriptional profiles of over 14,000 single cells collected from healthy and immune challenged zebrafish using 10x genomics and Smart-seq2 methodology (please see Explanatory Note in Supplementary Material).\n– “Single cell atlas of innate and adaptive lymphocytes in zebrafish” section; Hernández et al. (2018) \n\nWe can then track down this explanatory note3 to see what it has to say;\n\nAvailable datasets includes Smart-seq2 data from kidney, thymus, spleen, guts and gills of healthy, unstimulated wild-type zebrafish as well as 10x datasets from gut of unstimulated zebrafish both wild-type and rag1-/- mutant and immune-challenged (V. anguillarum- or A. simplex-injected) rag1-/- mutant.\n– Supplementary Material; Explanatory Note Hernández et al. (2018) \n\nWe know the 10x experiment contains over 10,000 cells, and experienced immune challenges. Ours doesn’t. Our dataset should be from multiple body parts (corroborated by the sample characteristics of our dataset) and the 10x dataset should only be from the gut (corroborated by the sample characteristics of the other dataset).\nThe above quote also points out that all our zebrafish were wild-type. Interestingly, the sample characteristics of our dataset do list multiple genotypes, including rag1-/- mutants. The quote seems to imply that rag1-/- is not “wild-type”, as does the rest of the paper. However, the rest of the paper does explicitly say that the Smart-seq2 data contains rag1-/- mutants, so I assume this was either an oversight by the authors or a minor misinterpretation on my part4. Either way, I’m satisfied with this understanding; we can move on to the tissue preparation.\n\n\nAbout rag1-/- mutants\n\n\nWell, maybe not move on just yet; I’m just a bit curious as to what a rag1-/- mutant is! According to “RAG1 Gene” (2017), it’s related to VDJ-recombination (something that was briefly mentioned, but not expanded on, in a prior blogpost)). It stands for “recombination activating gene 1”, and when it is absent it can really mess up your immune system as VDJ-recombination is essential for B and T cells to adapt to new pathogens. For a paper specifically on this mutation’s effects in zebrafish, see Hohn and Petrie-Hanson (2012) and Petrie-Hanson, Hohn, and Hanson (2009).\n\n\n\n\nTissue Preparation\n\nKidneys from heterozygote transgenic zebrafish either wild-type or rag1-/- mutant, were dissected and processed as previously described (Athanasiadis et al. 2017). The guts, spleens, gills and thymuses were dissected and placed in ice cold PBS/5% foetal bovine serum.\n– FACS Sorting Subsection; Materials and Methods Section; Hernández et al. (2018) \n\nWhich gives us another paper to read! Also, I never thought I’d read the phrase “ice cold fetal bovine serum”…\n\nA single kidney from heterozygote transgenic or wild-type fish was dissected and placed in ice cold PBS/5% foetal bovine serum.\n– Single-Cell Sorting Subsection; Methods Section; Athanasiadis et al. (2017) \n\nDespite being given another paper to read, it seems that the same dissection type was used for all organs. That reduces the amount of work for us!\n\n\nCell Isolation\nThey used FACS (Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting). There’s a brief overview of it available from “Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)” (n.d.).\n\nFor [the] Smart-seq2 experiment individual cells were index sorted into 96 well plates using a BD Influx Index Sorter\n– FACS Sorting Subsection; Materials and Methods Section; Hernández et al. (2018) \n\n\n\n96\n\n\nWhy does the number 96 keep popping up??? I’ll never know.\n\n\n\n\nLibrary Preparation and Sequencing\n\nThe Smart-seq2 protocol was used for whole transcriptome amplification and library preparation as previously described. Generated libraries were sequenced in pair-end mode on [a] Hi-Seq4000 platform.\n– Plate-Based Single-Cell RNA processing Subsection; Materials and Methods Section; Hernández et al. (2018) \n\nThis is short and straight to the point. They say a bit more about sequencing later:\n\nFor the samples that were processed using the Smart-seq2 protocol, the reads were aligned to the zebrafish reference genome (Ensemble BioMart version 89) combined with the sequences for EGFP, mCherry, mhc2dab and ERCC spike-ins. Salmon v0.8.2 (Patro et al. 2017) was used for both alignment and quantification of reads with the default paired-end parameters, while library type was set to inward (I) relative orientation (reads face each other) with unstranded (U) protocol (parameter –l IU).\n– Alignment and Quantification of Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data; Materials and Methods Section; Hernández et al.

    "text": "Acquiring and Exploring the Dataset\nThe page for this dataset on the Single Cell Expression Atlas contains a download tab. We want the raw counts matrix (we don’t want to use the normalized counts, since we intend to recreate their analysis and that includes normalizing the counts ourselves!).\nThe file we’re interested in, after downloading and unzipping, is E-MTAB-7117.aggregated_filtered_counts.mtx. (The other files are important too; they’re the row and column names!) We can read the file in using R.\n\nraw.counts &lt;- Matrix::readMM('./localdata/E-MTAB-7117.aggregated_filtered_counts.mtx')\n\nLet’s take a peak at this matrix to see what it’s like.\n\nprint(dim(raw.counts))\nraw.counts[1:10, 1:10]\nmax(raw.counts)\n\n[1] 21797   966\n\n\n10 x 10 sparse Matrix of class \"dgTMatrix\"\n                                          \n [1,] .   .         .      . .   . . . . .\n [2,] .   .         .      . .   . . . . .\n [3,] .   .         .      . .   . . . . .\n [4,] .   .        48.000 77 .   . . . . .\n [5,] 1 680.8777 1151.611  1 .   . . . . .\n [6,] .   .         .      . .   . . . . .\n [7,] .   .         .      . .   . . . . .\n [8,] .   .         .      . . 111 . . . .\n [9,] .   .         .      . .   . . . . .\n[10,] .   .         .      . .   . . . . .\n\n\n292841\n\n\nWe can see that the matrix is 21,797 by 966 - thus, there are 21,797 genes in the dataset and each column corresponds to a specific cell.\nStrangely, some values seem to be noninteger? Let’s consult the paper!\n\nFor each of the 542 single cells, counts reported by Salmon were transformed into normalised counts per million (CPM) and used for the further analysis. This was performed by dividing the number of counts for each gene with the total number of counts for each cell and by multiplying the resulting number by a factor of 1,000,000. Genes that were expressed in less than 1% of cells (e.g. 5 single cells with CPM &gt; 1) were filtered out. In the final step we ended up using 16,059 genes across the 542 single cells. The scran R package (version 1.6.7) Lun, Bach, and Marioni (2016) was then used to normalise the data and remove differences due to the library size or capture efficiency and sequencing depth.\n– Downstream Analysis of Smart-seq2 Data; Materials and Methods Section; Hernández et al. (2018) \n\nThis explains the non-integer values; there’s division involved in producing them.\nHowever, we’ve found a new discrepancy! Why are there 966 cells in the dataset, when we should only have 542? Let’s read a bit more of the paper:\n\nFor the Smart-seq2 protocol transcript per million (TPM) values reported by Salmon were used for the quality control (QC). Wells with fewer than 900 expressed genes (TPM &gt; 1) or having more than either 60% of ERCC or 45% of mitochondrial content were annotated as poor quality cells. As a result, 322 cells failed QC and 542 single cells were selected for the further study.\n– Quality Control of Single-Cell Data; Materials and Methods Section; Hernández et al. (2018) \n\nSo 322 cells failed quality control - but that still only brings us up to 864 cells, 102 too few. Let’s download the experiment design table from the Single Cell Expression Atlas, as we’ll need it for later anyways (it contains non-gene info about the samples) and because it contains info on sample quality via the fields “well information” and “single cell quality”.

For some reason, we start with 90 extra rows (cells) in this dataset! We can filter out the obviously bad entries, but we still have 10 extra rows. There’s a field “cluster” which we can use to get the post-filtered value of 542, although I’m fairly certain that these clusters were created after the analysis rather than as part of the data creation, hence why there’s only 542.\nSince we know the names of all ‘names’ of all the samples in our experiment design table, we can compare this with the list of row names for our gene count matrix to hopefully shed some light on what’s going wrong:\n\n# Grab the lists of genes in the experiment\n# and in the gene counts, for comparison\nexperiment.assays &lt;- sample.data$Assay\ngene.assays &lt;- read.table(\n    './localdata/E-MTAB-7117.aggregated_filtered_counts.mtx_cols'\n)$V1\n\n\n# Get the list of genes that appear in the experiment data\n# but not the gene counts\ndiscrepancies &lt;- setdiff(experiment.assays, gene.assays)\nlength(discrepancies)\n\n90\n\n\n\n# Now get the experiment info of the 10 of these cells that\n# aren't filtered out by our previous filtering method\nextra.cells &lt;- sample.data[\n    which(sapply(experiment.assays, `%in%`, discrepancies)),\n]\nextra.cells &lt;- extra.cells[\n    which(\n        extra.cells['Sample.Characteristic.single.cell.quality.'] == \"OK\"\n    ),\n]\n\n\n# Show all columns.  There's probably a better way,\n# but oh well...\n# (I've hidden the outputs of this code block on the blog,\n# because it's just a bunch of ugly, unenlightening tables.)\nextra.cells[,1:10]\nextra.cells[,11:20]\nextra.cells[,21:30]\nextra.cells[,31:33]\n\nThe above contains the 10 outstanding cells. Frustratingly, there doesn’t seem to be any reason I can find as to why these cells were excluded at this stage!\nTo summarize:\n\nThe website reports 966 cells\nThe gene count table also reports 966 cells\nThe experiment table reports 1056 cells\nFlitering the experiment table yields 976 cells\nThe paper reports 864 cells pre-quality control\n\nThis isn’t an uncommon occurance; in fact, every time I’ve read a paper like this (which, admittedly, is only 3ish times) I’ve been unable to get a consistent answer on how many cells were actually used! It’s a major nuisance.\nWe’ll pick up where we left off in the next blog post. While annoying, this discrepancy isn’t fatal - we can perform quality control on the 976 cells we get from filtering.\n\nReferences\n\n\nAthanasiadis, E. I., J. G. Botthof, H. Andres, L. Ferreira, P.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Here, we will be looking at a paper (Vincent Prost 2021) that uses metagenomics data - specifically that of the LifeLines-DEEP gut microbiome data (Zhernakova et al. 2016).\nSpecifically, we want to recreate the following image:\n# This gives us a 1135x3957 matrix (people x species) of 16s rRNA counts `counts`\n# And a dataframe `taxmat` of 3957 rows giving taxonomic information\nload(\"localdata/ll_deep.rda\")\nInterestingly, there seem to be too many species! There are 3957 species here but there’re clearly less than that in the graph1. The paper does have this to say about it:\nFrustratingly, the image we want to recreate is actually Figure 4 in the paper. Since both figures are interrelated and both are part of the short section “Inference of real-world microbial association networks”, I think it’s reasonable that this filtering method was used for both. It is pretty annoying that it’s not more clear, though.\n# This is their own filtering code, from:\n# https://github.com/vincentprost/Zi-LN/blob/master/venn.R\n# Although I've broken it up a bit to make it more amenable to commenting\n\n# Get a boolean 1135x3957 matrix of whether the species\n# was found in the person or not\nnonzeros &lt;- counts &gt; 0\n\n# Get the number of distinct people that possessed each species\nnum.nonzeros &lt;- apply(nonzeros, 2, sum)\n\n# Get the total amount of people\ntotal.cells &lt;- dim(counts)[1]\n\n# Only keep the species who appear in more than 20% of the people\nkeep.indices &lt;- (num.nonzeros / total.cells) &gt; 0.2\ncounts_el &lt;- as.matrix(counts[, keep.indices])\ntaxmat_el &lt;- taxmat[keep.indices,]\n\n# We should now only be looking at 565 species\ndim(counts_el)\n\n\n1135565\nNow that we have the data filtered in what we hope is the same manner as the paper, we can try to run their analysis. At a high level, the key idea of this paper is to model the data as being some transform of a gaussian latent variable \\(z\\). They wrote a function infer_Z to estimate the latent \\(z\\), after which they can use a technique to estimate the precision matrix, which should give us the association network for the microbes[^I haven’t done a blog post on Gaussian Graphical Models before, but I should… This section will make more sense if you have a background in them.].\n# Load the code from the paper\nsource(\"./localdata/Zi-LN-master/inference.R\")\nsource(\"./localdata/Zi-LN-master/utils/utils.R\")\n# Get the zs\noptions(warn = -1) # turn warnings off because otherwise it's gonna scream...\nzs &lt;- infer_Z(counts_el)\ndim(zs)\n\n\n1135565\nNow we need to infer the precision matrix. We’re stuck again referring to their methodology for Figure 5. Even more annoyingly, they do not use the regularization parameter that they used, but rather just say that they kept the top 1200 edges. So I had to run manual experiments to find out! Spoiler alert, the parameter is \\(\\lambda = 0.251\\)\n# Desired sparsity level (multiply by 2 b/c symmetric)\n(2 * 1200) / (565*565)\n\n0.00751820816038844\nlibrary(\"huge\")\nlibrary(\"igraph\")\nprecision.matrix &lt;- huge(zs, lambda = 0.251)\n\nConducting Meinshausen & Buhlmann graph estimation (mb)....done\nprecision.matrix\n\nModel: Meinshausen & Buhlmann graph estimation (mb)\nInput: The Data Matrix\nPath length: 1 \nGraph dimension: 565 \nSparsity level: 0.007531538 -----&gt; 0.007531538\nassociations &lt;- precision.matrix$path[[1]]\n\n# Number of edges, to verify we've done it right\nsum(associations) / 2\n\n1200\nadjacency.graph = graph.adjacency(associations, mode = \"undirected\")\nplot(adjacency.graph)\nThere we go, we’ve plotted it!

We do end up with much more disconnected species, and I don’t really understand why because in their code they literally run:\nWhere l is whatever lambda value causes 1200 edges. That code, however, is for Figure 5 whereas we want to replicate Figure 4; perhaps they chose a different l for Figure 4? But we’ll stop here for now."

I don’t have an answer to that mystery, unfortunately - but in my experience this mismatch happens in a lot of papers. We might as well continue with the analysis, rather than getting hung up on a minor anomaly.\nI realized since yesterday that there was another gene counts file, (the filtered tpms file).

So the mystery continues!\n\n\nQuality Control\nThe raw.counts matrix is a Sparse Matrix with 21,797 genes and 966 cells - the values are expressed in TPM. Our goal is to filter out the low quality cells.\n\nFor the Smart-seq2 protocol transcript per million (TPM) values reported by Salmon were used for the quality control (QC). Wells with fewer than 900 expressed genes (TPM &gt; 1) or having more than either 60% of ERCC or 45% of mitochondrial content were annotated as poor quality cells. As a result, 322 cells failed QC and 542 single cells were selected for the further study.\n– Quality Control of Single-Cell Data; Materials and Methods Section; Hernández et al. (2018) \n\nAt the time, I didn’t think we could find the mitochondrial genes with the data we had (and same with ERCC). I’ve gone back and edited this though, in the dropdowns.\n\n\nGetting mitochondrial genes\n\nI used Python since chronologically I did this ater I gave up on R. The work to create the mito-genes csv was done in the blog post Exploring Ensembl.\n\nmito_genes = pd.read_csv(\"./localdata/mito-genes.csv\")\nmito_genes[\"gene_id\"].head()\n\n0    ENSDARG00000083480\n1    ENSDARG00000082753\n2    ENSDARG00000081443\n3    ENSDARG00000080337\n4    ENSDARG00000083046\nName: gene_id, dtype: object\n\n\nNow we want to calculate the percent of genomic material per cell that is contained in just the genes in mito_genes, which should not be too hard! Left as excersize to the reader.\n\n\n\nGetting ERCC genes\n\nI could not figure out how to do this; I think they have already been removed from the dataset that we have.\n\nBut yesterday we noticed that we could get the 542 futher-study cells by looking at the metadata and only grabbing the cells which were eventually assigned a cluster by the researchers.\n\n# Calculate the cells we want to study\nsample.data &lt;- read.table(\"./localdata/ExpDesign-E-MTAB-7117.tsv\", sep='\\t', header=TRUE)\nfiltered &lt;- sample.data[which(\n    sample.data['Sample.Characteristic.cluster.'] != \"unknown\"\n),]\ncells.to.study &lt;- filtered$Assay\nlength(cells.to.study)\n\n542\n\n\n\n# Get which rows correspond to which assay (cell)\nassay.to.row.map &lt;- read.table(\n    './localdata/E-MTAB-7117.expression_tpm.mtx_cols'\n)$V1\nlength(assay.to.row.map)\n\n966\n\n\n\n# Subset the raw.counts matrix\nraw.counts.filtered &lt;- raw.counts[,\n    which(sapply(assay.to.row.map, `%in%`, cells.to.study)),\n]\ndim(raw.counts.filtered)\n# Save the matrix, for posterity\nwriteMM(raw.counts.filtered, \"./localdata/542_cells_21797_genes.tpm.mtx\")\n\n\n21797542\n\n\nNULL\n\n\nNow we need to perform quality control on the genes;\n\nFor each of the 542 single cells, counts reported by Salmon were transformed into normalised counts per million (CPM) and used for the further analysis. This was performed by dividing the number of counts for each gene with the total number of counts for each cell and by multiplying the resulting number by a factor of 1,000,000. Genes that were expressed in less than 1% of cells (e.g. 5 single cells with CPM &gt; 1) were filtered out. In the final step we ended up using 16,059 genes across the 542 single cells. The scran R package (version 1.6.7) Lun, Bach, and Marioni (2016) was then used to normalise the data and remove differences due to the library size or capture efficiency and sequencing depth.\n– Downstream Analysis of Smart-seq2 Data; Materials and Methods Section; Hernández et al. (2018) \n\nIt was harder than expected, as I am less-than-fluent with R and their sparse matrix operations weren’t as analogous to dense matrices as I would have liked. First let’s take a look at our the sparse datatype we have. I found the blogpost by Slowikowski (2020) useful, but ultimately got fed up with R and decided to transition to python.\n\n\nFalse Start: Trying to use R\n\n\nstr(raw.counts.filtered)\n\nFormal class 'dgTMatrix' [package \"Matrix\"] with 6 slots\n  ..@ i       : int [1:1156509] 4 10 19 36 56 57 58 59 62 69 ...\n  ..@ j       : int [1:1156509] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n  ..@ Dim     : int [1:2] 21797 542\n  ..@ Dimnames:List of 2\n  .. ..$ : NULL\n  .. ..$ : NULL\n  ..@ x       : num [1:1156509] 0.593 145.541 361.733 0.178 0.107 ...\n  ..@ factors : list()\n\n\n(i, j) gives us the rows and columns, with the value being the corresponding entry in x. The T in dgTMatrix stands for triplet, because it’s essentially just a list of triplets (i, j, x). Another common format is CsparseMatrix, although the explanation is more complicated.

They’re a bit more strict than that - it has to have a CPM of at least 1 to count as being “expressed”.\n\nraw_counts_expressed = raw_counts_normed.copy()\nraw_counts_expressed[raw_counts_expressed &lt;= 1] = 0\nraw_counts_expressed[raw_counts_expressed &gt; 1] = 1\nnumber_of_cells_gene_appears_in = raw_counts_expressed.sum(axis=1)\nraw_counts_genes_filtered = raw_counts_normed[\n    number_of_cells_gene_appears_in &gt; 5,\n    :\n].copy()\n\n\nraw_counts_genes_filtered\n\n&lt;17832x542 sparse array of type '&lt;class 'numpy.float64'&gt;'\n    with 1141288 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format&gt;\n\n\nWe have too many genes and I’m not sure why - however, I can’t find anywhere in their paper a count of the pre-filtered genes. Just like how their dataset contains more cells than reported, it may contain more genes than reported!\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nIn order to identify the highly variable genes (HVGs) we utilised the Brennecke Method (Brennecke et al. 2013). We inferred the noise model from the ERCCs and selected genes that vary higher than 20% percentage of variation. This was performed by using the “BrenneckeGetVariableGenes” command of M3Drop v1.4.0 R package setting fdr equal to 0.01 and minimum percentage of variance due to biological factors (minBiolDisp) equal to 0.2. In total, 3,374 were annotated as HVGs.\n– Downstream Analysis of Smart-seq2 Data; Materials and Methods Section; Hernández et al. (2018) \n\nThe BrenneckeGetVariableGenes method is described in the M3Drop documentation as follows:\n\n\n\nBrenneckeGetVariableGenes\n\n\nThus we can see that we need the ERCCs to deduce the HGVs. However, I can’t find any data on the ERCC spike-ins, so at this point we stop here. Sorry to disappoint.\n\nReferences\n\n\nBrennecke, P., S. Anders, J. K. Kim, A. A. Kołodziejczyk, X. Zhang, V.

    "text": "So, I’ve been working on blog posts that do a walkthrough on working with genetic data. I keep running into issues and having to go on sidequests (😅) but I think this one deserves its own blog post. Shoutout to Morgan for the help.\n\n\n\nThe Ensemble homepage\n\n\nA major resource in bioinformatics is Ensembl. In this blog post, we’ll spend some time exploring it, capping off with using it to accomplish the useful task of how to grab all known mitochondrial genes in Zebrafish (Danio rerio).\nSuppose in our dataset we had a gene called ENSDARG00000000001. What can we actually say about it? Well, first of all, this is an Ensembl ID, so it follows the pattern ENS[species prefix][feature type prefix][a unique eleven digit number]. In this case, DAR is the species (Danio rerio) and G indicates that it is referring to a gene.\nWe can look this gene up on Ensembl to learn more about it:\n\nThis gene is also known as slc35a5, but these names can be harder to work with as it is subject to change if our knowledge about its role in biological processes changes; the Ensembl ID is more permanent. On the other hand, this name is arguably more informative, as it is an abbreviation for its role as “solute carrier family 35 member A5”.\nIf we want to investigate this gene more, we can click on the ZFIN link provided in the summary section.\n\n\n\nZFIN page for ENSDARG00000000001\n\n\nHere we can see yet another gene ID (ZDB-GENE-030616-55), as well as a link to the naming history of this gene which may be fun to explore. There are some other goodies on this page, but we’ll return to Enbembl as that is the topic of this post.\nOur goal is to get a list of all mitochondrial genes in Danio rerio. ENSDARG00000000001 is not a mitochondrial gene, because it is located on chromosome 9. One way to find a list of mitochondrial genes is to search for genes with names beginning with mt-, because that is how mitochondrial genes are named.\n\nHowever, this isn’t convenient for manual use!\n\n\nFailed attempt at using scanpy\n\nOne way to try to get this data is to use scanpy:\n\n# I had to also install pybiomart, which was only on pip\nfrom scanpy import queries\n\n\nqueries.mitochondrial_genes(\n    \"drerio\",\n    attrname = \"ensembl_gene_id\"\n)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHTTPError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[3], line 1\n----&gt; 1 queries.mitochondrial_genes(\n      2     \"drerio\",\n      3     attrname = \"ensembl_gene_id\"\n      4 )\n\nFile ~/opt/anaconda3/envs/Blog-nbdev/lib/python3.9/site-packages/scanpy/queries/_queries.py:191, in mitochondrial_genes(org, attrname, host, use_cache, chromosome)\n    156 @_doc_params(doc_org=_doc_org, doc_host=_doc_host, doc_use_cache=_doc_use_cache)\n    157 def mitochondrial_genes(\n    158     org: str,\n   (...)\n    163     chromosome: str = \"MT\",\n    164 ) -&gt; pd.DataFrame:\n    165     \"\"\"\\\n    166     Mitochondrial gene symbols for specific organism through BioMart.\n    167 \n   (...)\n    189     &gt;&gt;&gt; mito_gene_names_fly = sc.queries.mitochondrial_genes(\"dmelanogaster\", chromosome=\"mitochondrion_genome\")\n    190     \"\"\"\n--&gt; 191     return simple_query(\n    192         org,\n    193         attrs=[attrname],\n    194         filters={\"chromosome_name\": [chromosome]},\n    195         host=host,\n    196         use_cache=use_cache,\n    197     )\n\nFile ~/opt/anaconda3/envs/Blog-nbdev/lib/python3.9/site-packages/scanpy/queries/_queries.py:67, in simple_query(org, attrs, filters, host, use_cache)\n     63     raise ImportError(\n     64         \"This method requires the `pybiomart` module to be installed.\"\n     65     )\n     66 server = Server(host, use_cache=use_cache)\n---&gt; 67 dataset = server.marts[\"ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL\"].datasets[\n     68     \"{}_gene_ensembl\".format(org)\n     69 ]\n     70 res = dataset.query(attributes=attrs, filters=filters, use_attr_names=True)\n     71 return res\n\nFile ~/opt/anaconda3/envs/Blog-nbdev/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pybiomart/server.py:61, in Server.marts(self)\n     59 \"\"\"List of available marts.\"\"\"\n     60 if self._marts is None:\n---&gt; 61     self._marts = self._fetch_marts()\n     62 return self._marts\n\nFile ~/opt/anaconda3/envs/Blog-nbdev/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pybiomart/server.py:79, in Server._fetch_marts(self)\n     78 def _fetch_marts(self):\n---&gt; 79     response = self.get(type='registry')\n     81     xml = xml_from_string(response.content)\n     82     marts = [\n     83         self._mart_from_xml(child)\n     84         for child in xml.findall('MartURLLocation')\n     85     ]\n\nFile ~/opt/anaconda3/envs/Blog-nbdev/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pybiomart/base.py:111, in ServerBase.get(self, **params)\n    109     with requests_cache.disabled():\n    110         r = requests.get(self.url, params=params)\n--&gt; 111 r.raise_for_status()\n    112 return r\n\nFile ~/opt/anaconda3/envs/Blog-nbdev/lib/python3.9/site-packages/requests/models.py:1021, in Response.raise_for_status(self)\n   1016     http_error_msg = (\n   1017         f\"{self.status_code} Server Error: {reason} for url: {self.url}\"\n   1018     )\n   1020 if http_error_msg:\n-&gt; 1021     raise HTTPError(http_error_msg, response=self)\n\nHTTPError: 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: http://www.ensembl.org:80/biomart/martservice?type=registry\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Biomart was down at the time I tried to do this!

(It goes up to 8% if you use the unfiltered data).\n\n\nSidequest: What is the largest percent of a dataset that we can make be outliers?\n\nWell, assuming you have a dataset with 4 elements, the IQR is determined by the middle two elements; you can move the outer two as far away from it as possible. Thus you can force them to be outliers, giving you an outlier percentage of 50%.\nThis should be optimal, because at least 50% of the data has to lie within the IQR by the definition of the IQR.\n\n\n\n50%\nNormally I’d be reluctant to remove these, but we have so much data that it’d be nice to shave some of it off1.\n\nfiltered.counts.iqr &lt;- filtered.counts.mito.2[, !outliers.index]\nfiltered.row.info.iqr &lt;- filtered.row.info.mito.2\nfiltered.col.info.iqr &lt;- filtered.col.info.mito.2[!outliers.index, ]\n\n\ndim(filtered.counts.iqr)\n\n\n2326418757"

We also filtered out the genes with average counts below 0.01 assuming these low-abundance genes to be unreliable for statistical inference.\n\nThe question is - what is this deconvolution-based method? I found this helpful resource which describes it well. Essentially, we want to be able to normalize each cell by their library size, but due to the sparsity of scRNA-seq we need to pool cells together to achieve sufficient mass.

    "text": "Standard output of ls\n\n\nFor years now my Mac has been patiently pestering me to change my terminal from bash to zsh, so I bit the bullet today and did it. This got me thinking about what a shell actually is, and their ability to be customized. This quest brought to my attention that the ls command, which prints files in a directory, has some optional flags you can pass to it!\n\n\n\nYou can reformat the output to give more detailed information with ls -l.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can color directories differently with ls -G.\n\n\nYou can even combine the two with ls -lG, but I’ll let you try that for yourself.\nI like this very much, so I thought I would try to control the colors that are outputted. To do this, I went into my ~/.zshrc file (presumably if I kept with bash it would be ~/.bashrc) - this is the file that runs every time you create a new terminal. The current contents of this file were:\n# &gt;&gt;&gt; conda initialize &gt;&gt;&gt;\n# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!\n__conda_setup=\"$('/Users/baileyandrew/mambaforge/bin/conda' 'shell.zsh' 'hook' 2&gt; /dev/null)\"\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    eval \"$__conda_setup\"\nelse\n    if [ -f \"/Users/baileyandrew/mambaforge/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" ]; then\n        . \"/Users/baileyandrew/mambaforge/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\"\n    else\n        export PATH=\"/Users/baileyandrew/mambaforge/bin:$PATH\"\n    fi\nfi\nunset __conda_setup\n\nif [ -f \"/Users/baileyandrew/mambaforge/etc/profile.d/mamba.sh\" ]; then\n    . \"/Users/baileyandrew/mambaforge/etc/profile.d/mamba.sh\"\nfi\n# &lt;&lt;&lt; conda initialize &lt;&lt;&lt;\nWhich I assume was auto-created when I first installed conda/mamba.\nI then added the following:\n# &gt;&gt;&gt; my custom scripts &gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nexport CLICOLOR=1\nexport LSCOLORS=\"gxfxcxdxbxegedabagacad\"\n\n# &lt;&lt;&lt; my custom scripts &lt;&lt;&lt;\n\n\n\nThe result of ls -lG.\n\n\nSo its clear I can affect the colors, but they’re not the colors I want. And here’s where I get sad - I wanted the to customize specific colors, but terminals are limited to only 256 (whyyyyyyy) and I don’t have fine-grained control over which file type gets which color.\nThe end."

    "text": "How many solutions are there?\nIt’s not difficult, but hella annoying, to work out that there are 12. This corresponds to the following OEIS sequence. Ignoring the grid restrictions sudoku is just a “Latin Square” puzzle; fit the numbers 1 to n in an nxn square without having the same number twice in a column/row. There are many possible 4x4 latin squares (576, to be precise).\nHowever, it doesn’t really feel like rotating a latin square by 90° should produce a new latin square - the two squares are still essentially the same. More precisely, we want to account for symmetry. There are 4 types of symmetries that a latin square can have:\n\nRotational (4 different types)\nReflectional (2 different types)\n\nIt might feel like there are more, depending on your axis of reflection - but we can account for this using the rotations, so we really only need one axis of reflection\n\nPermutational (24 different types)\n\nWe could easily swap every occurance of 1 with 2 and vice versa, but the square is still “the same”. This is permutational symmetry, in which we change which numbers are which but not where they are.\n(24 = 4!)\n\nRow-permutational (24 different types)\n\nWe can change the order of the rows without changing the latin square\nColumn permutations can be done using a rotation first\n\n\nThe first three symmetries all still apply when we add a grid, but the fourth one could destroy our grid by splitting one of our boxes into two disconnected components. Typically we don’t allow this, so I’m treating puzzles that are row-permutationally equivalent to be different.\nIt turns out that there are only 4 different latin squares, accounting for all 4 symmetries - but when we ignore row-permutational symmetries, there are 12 different latin squares. To my knowledge, these are not enumerated anywhere on the internet.\n\n\n\nThe 12 Sudokus\n\n\nIn the above image, I wrote the solutions in a number-agnostic way to emphasize the permutation symmetry."

The question of how many grids there are can be rephrased as “how many ways can a 4x4 square be decomposed into tetrominos”? For this, I refer the reader to the mayhematics site which has a nice writeup. These are the grids:\n\n\n\nThe Grids\n\n\nUnlike the solutions, we do need to take into account symmetric versions of the grids - this is because we want to combine solutions and grids, so we need to combine them in all orientations. We could have instead done this with the solutions, and only considered the 22 fundamental grids. Instead we have 117 grids, although I won’t write them all out."

I should note also that in an R notebook, we could still run Python:\n#%%python3\nprint(\"Hello\")\nprint(\"World\")\n\nHello\nWorld\nThere are 3 flaws with this approach: * Syntax highlighting not correct - No big deal, highlighting R as if it were Pyhon should be mostly fine * No persistent variables - This could be pretty annoying for some tasks * Need both R and Python in the same conda environment - This is a big deal as they have mutual dependencies that they fight over, preventing conda installation of Bioconductor packages (as far as I can tell; my diagnosis might not be perfect)\nTo fix the last flaw, I could potentially write a bash script that handles environment activation and deactivation, and to fix the middle flaw I could potentially save / load .Rdata files in such a script as well. However, I’d rather not have to write my own bash script - they scare me 😅."

    "text": "Today we’ll be looking at the paper “A single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the developing chicken limb”, by Feregrino et al. (2019) - specifically, we’ll use this dataset from the Single Cell Expression Atlas. However, we’re not actually gonna read their paper, we’re just gonna do random stuff!\nSpoilers: We don’t get much work done, due to a mystery involving chicken breeds in Ensembl.\nI wanted to perform QC using mitochondrial genes. This should have been as easy as reusing my code for humans with a few tweaks to look for chicken genes instead. However, when I try to use biomaRt I get no result.\nmart &lt;- useDataset(\"ggallus_gene_ensembl\", useMart(\"ensembl\"))\n\ngene.to.symbol.map &lt;- getBM(\n    filters=\"ensembl_gene_id\",\n    attributes=c(\n        \"ensembl_gene_id\",\n        \"hgnc_symbol\"\n    ),\n    values=rownames(sce),\n    mart=mart\n)\ngene.to.symbol.map\n\n\nA data.frame: 0 × 2\n\n\nensembl_gene_id\nhgnc_symbol\n\n\n&lt;lgl&gt;\n&lt;lgl&gt;\nSo I went directly to the biomaRt web interface, and searched for a gene I knew was in the dataset: ENSGALG00000000003\nHowever, you can see that in the top left corner it reports no results! If you look closely, you can see that the example search is with ENSGALG00010000002, which does have results - and in fact adding 10,000,000 to gene numbers tends to create a valid findable gene:\nThese genes don’t seem to be related to eachother though.\nIf we filter for mitochondrial genes:\nThen we do get results:\nWhich all have ids greater than 10,000,000. This list is not comprehensive, I can find (off biomaRt) another mitochondrial gene, whose id is less than 10,000,000:\nFrom the above, we can see that there should be 24 mt-rRNA and mt-tRNA in total, which is in fact what we find with biomaRt! (The previous image only shows 10, but that’s because it only shows 10 per page - the total amount found was 24).\nThese two images seem to conclusively show that the gene sets are different; the genes are in a similar place but have different names between the two tracks.\nFrom this, we can hypothesize that the ids less than 10,000,000 are out of date, presenting some frustration for using the data we have. Can we prove it?\nNo: the gene has never changed its ID (which is a good thing for sanity purposes but is not ideal for this specific confusion).\nHowever, it seems like there are multiple chicken genomes in Ensembl:\nThis proves, conclusively, that there are at least two breeds of chicken. And I was looking at the wrong one.\nThe question then becomes - how do we actually find the right one?

    "text": "But why?\nI’m left with one question: why are there two chickens? Why is the junglefowl no longer on modern BioMart? What is their relation? (Ahhhhhhhhhhhh)\nI did manage to find a summary of some chicken breeds, but it did not resolve my question.\nTo investigate further, I went through the history of the Ensembl versions:\n\nVersion 108 (current, October 2022): Default chicken is bGalGal1.mat.broiler.GRCg7b\n\nBut when we look at the chicken breeds page they list it as bGalGal1.pat.whiteleghornlayer.GRCg7w\n\nVersion 107 (July 2022): Default chicken is bGalGal1.mat.broiler.GRCg7b\n\nAlthough in this version they call it the “maternal broiler”\nAnd when we look at the chicken breeds page they list it as bGalGal1.pat.whiteleghornlayer.GRCg7w\n\nVersion 106 (April 2022): Default chicken is GRCg6a\n\nAnd there is no chicken breeds page\n\n\nIt seems like the chicken breeds pages don’t list the default breed on it, and that all of the genes for GRCg7w are listed with IDs beginning with 00015 (such as here). This is in contrast with the 00010 beginning for GRCg7b and GRCg6a.\nThus, we can say this:\n\nThere are three chickens in play1, GRCg6a (“red junglefowl”), GRCg7w (“white leghorn”), and GRCg7b (“maternal broiler”).\nGRCg7b (“maternal broiler”) is the current default\nGRCg6a (“red junglefowl”) used to be the default back in version 106\n\nLooking up “maternal broiler”, I am able to find this page talking about the bGalGal1.mat.broiler.GRCg7b genome. It lists its breed as specifically being:\n\nBreed: Cross of Broiler mother + white leghorn layer father\n\nThis only deepens the mystery. Why did we go from Red Junglefowl to Maternal Broiler? How does the White Leghorn come into the picture, and is it related to why GRCg7w is a crossbreed?\n\nThe chicken has been the most studied bird. It serves as a model organism for basic and biomedical science, and is one of the most commonly consumed food sources for humans.\nThis trio of samples was collected to create a high-quality reference genome for two haplotypes.\nThe female offspring (bGalGal1) is a cross between a modern broiler breeder mother (bGalGal2) and white Leghorn father (bGalGal3).\nBreeding and sample collection was conducted by Nick Anthony at the University of Arkansas, in coordination with Wesley Warren, Ron Okimoto, Hans Cheng, and Rachel Hawken.\nBlood from these samples were used to create high-quality reference genome assemblies of each haplotype, coordinated by Erich Jarvis, Wesley Warren, and Olivier Fedrigo, at the Rockefeller University Vertebrate Genome Lab, as part of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) and the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC).\n– Webpage for GRCg7b\n\nThe webpage identifies GRCg7b as coming from bGalGal3 and GRCg7w as coming from bGalGal2.\nIt seems bGalGal1 does not have its own assembly, as the list of chicken assemblies does not include it. The most information I can get as to bGalGal1 is on its sample page, which is significantly less detailed than its parent’s. As an aside, it seems like a lot of new chicken assemblies were made in 2022, which may be interesting for the future.\nAccording to the page for bGalGal3, the GRCg7w assembly has been updated to GRCg7w_WZ. I believe this did not require getting more real-world data, but rather was a re-sequencing (re-assembling) of the collected data."

A biopsy is when bits of you get removed to be examined clinically.\n\n\nSidequest: The Christie NHS Foundation Trust\n\nIt would be nice to say that the patients reside in the Manchester, but this is not necessarily true. The feeding area for the hopsital may be larger than that, and also if epithelial ovarian cancer is rare enough it might attract patients from further afield. What we’re interested in is catchment; the locations from which people come into the hospital. Conveniently, The Christie has catchment info on their website. It reveals that for gynaecological cancers such as epithelial ovarian cancer, 73% of the patients are from Manchester, and 97% are from the North West.\nSurprisingly, the North West has an official definition:\n\nNorth West England is one of nine official regions of England and consists of the administrative counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside\n– Wikipedia, the most trustworthy of sources\n\n\nIt also mostly answers the who question; patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. In the pursuit of more details, we can refer to:\n\nBetween May 2016 and June 2019, we collected 312 samples from patients with chemo-naïve and relapsed disease, either as solid biopsies or as ascites (Fig. 1a)\n\n\nTen patients had HGSOC while two had mucinous ovarian carcinoma. Longitudinal biopsies were collected from three patients.\n\n\n\nAn ascites is an abnormal abdominal buildup of fluid.\nWhich conveniently answers when and how many. Fig 1 in the paper provides further specificity, revealing that there are 12 patients.\nWe should probably find out what and why but the what is presumably just “wherever the tumour is” and for why presumably patients were included if and only if they had epithelial ovarian cancer at The Christie."

If we did not fragment the RNA, then we would need large read length to read the base pairs in the middle of a long RNA strand. Fragmentation is not necessary if your read length is longer than the largest RNA molecule (or unlimited). Fragmentation puts extra strain on downstream analysis, because we need to reconstruct the original sequence from the fragments. Furthermore, fragmentation isn’t random; the techniques used to break up the RNA may preferentially cause breaks in some places compared to others.

    "text": "Tagmentation\n\nRecent development in using transposon-based, so-called tagmentation method has made it simple to fragment cDNA and add adapter sequences at the same time. In this method, an active variant of the Tn5 transposase mediates the fragmentation of double-stranded DNA and ligates adapter oligonucleotides at both ends in a quick reaction (~5 min). However, it is notable that Tn5 and other enzyme-based cDNA fragmentation methods require a precise enzyme:DNA ratio, making method optimization less straightforward than RNA fragmentation. Consequently, fragmenting RNA is currently still the most frequently used approach in RNA-Seq library preparation.\n–  Fragmentation Subsection; General Aspects OF RNA-Seq Section; Hrdlickova, Toloue, and Tian (2017) \n\nLigation is the joining of two nucleic acid fragments through the action of an enzyme - at least, according to Wikipedia. It seems that this is just the combination of fragmentation and tagging with the adapter oligonucleotides. These processes used to need to be done sequentially.\n\n\nWhy do we want to tag the adapter with oligonucleotides?\n\nThe tags are necessary to attach primers to your cDNA (Salamat 2018). This is described well during the following explanation of Index PCR:\n\nA single Illumina flow cell can sequence multiple samples as long as the expected reads will not saturate (exceed) the capacity of the flow cell. However, since the samples are pooled and loaded as one into the flow cell, there must be a mechanism to which to distinguish sequences from one sample to another. This is accomplished via a process called Index PCR. Here, custom oligonucleotides called index primers are used to amplify and ‘barcode’ the fragments. Each index primer contains the following: * Read (1 or 2) sequencing primer: a segment complementary to the ‘tag’ introduced during tagmentation, * Indexing sequence: a unique DNA sequence for identification / barcoding of samples * Sequencing Anchor (P5/P7): sequences complementary to the oligos in the flow cell. These allow the index PCR products (libraries) to bind to the Illumina flow cell for sequencing.\nSTEP 4: LIBRARY PREPARATION: AMPLIFICATION; Salamat (2018)\n\nFor an explanation on all the details here, see the section on Index PCR; essentially, the tags are necessary to hook an index primer into your cDNA, which is then necessary to hook it up with the oligos in your flow cell."

    "text": "UMI vs Full Length\n\nUMI is an acronym for Unique Molecular Identifier. UMIs are complex indices added to sequencing libraries before any PCR amplification steps, enabling the accurate bioinformatic identification of PCR duplicates. UMIs are also known as “Molecular Barcodes” or “Random Barcodes”\n– Tech (n.d.)\n\nUMIs are applied to individual strands of cDNA - i.e they are not applied to identify cells (barcoding) or samples (Unique Dual Indices (UDIs)), but individual transcripts of the original RNA. This can help accurately piece reads together when sequencing. The UMI will only be on one end of the strand and hence many reads will not contain the UMI on them, but when piecing them together post-fragmentation it can provide more information on what can be matched with what.\n\nThe main disadvantage of both Smart-seq protocols is that the generation of full-length cDNA libraries precludes an early barcoding step and the incorporation of UMIs.\n–  Fragmentation Subsection; General Aspects OF RNA-Seq Section; Hrdlickova, Toloue, and Tian (2017) \n\n\nOther protocols have sacrificed full-length coverage in order to sequence part of the primer used for cDNA generation. This enables early barcoding of libraries (i.e., the incorporation of cell-specific barcodes), allowing for multiplexing the cDNA amplification and thereby increasing the throughput of scRNA-seq library generation by one to three orders of magnitude\n–  Introduction Section; Hrdlickova, Toloue, and Tian (2017) \n\nNot all methods give full coverage of the transcripts; when they do, it is called full length."

    "text": "I work with single-cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA-seq), but I don’t really understand it… ELI5 is that scRNA-seq data is a list of cells, each of which has a list of genes in that cell. The goal of this blog post is to arrive at an understanding of these.\nA useful resource is the eBook from Single-Cell Sequencing Workflow: Critical Steps and Considerations (2019) outlining the scRNA-seq workflow. Illumina is one of the companies that creates products that make scRNA-seq possible.\n\n\n\nA graphical summary of the processes leading up to sequencing.\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in scRNA-seq analysis is to procure the actual samples for the analysis. It is perhaps the most important step, as the tissue preparation method can bias your results (some cells may be better suited to surviving certain preparation methods intact, for example). It also tends to be easier to collect “less clumpy” cells, like blood cells.\nThis makes intuitive sense, as we would need some way of reaching the cells inside a clump to prevent biasing our results towards cells that tend to inhabit the surface of a clump. Reaching these cells is called dissociation. For an example of how the dissociation protocol can effect the cells you get, see Denisenko et al. (2020).\nThe goal of dissociation is to break bonds between cells (to destroy the aforementioned clumps). These bonds can be broken mechanically or enzymatically, or through a combination of both. Bonds can also be broken via the manipulation of temperature. For an example of a dissociation protocol, see Quintanal-Villalonga et al. (2022).\nThe next (optional) step is enrichment. We do this to remove unwanted cells or boost the presence of wanted ones.\nAfter preparing the sample, we want to ensure the sample is high quality. I’ll summarize what Single-Cell Sequencing Workflow: Critical Steps and Considerations (2019) has to say on the matter:\n\nWe want to ensure that our dissociation and enrichment methods have not killed too many cells. We can detect residue from dead cells to acquire an estimate, and it seems in practice the standard is to have &gt;85% viable cells.\nIf our cells got broken to pieces, or if we failed to split cells up well, we would expect this info to be observable in a cell size distribution histogram.\nWe want our cells to be concentrated at the right amount.\n\nOne method of getting these methods is flow cytometry.\n\n\n\nOnce we’ve prepared our tissue, we need to isolate the cells from eachother. (Dissociation breaks up clumps, but that does not mean the de-clumped cells are isolated - they’re still together in the same solution).\nA key distinguisher between isolation methods is throughput. Older (mechanical) methods have low throughput, and can only feasibly isolate cells from a sample of size up to the thousands. More modern “high-throughput” methods can dramatically increase this.

I’m still learning about it, so don’t take my word as gospel.\n\n\nLibrary preparation is the collection of the bits of data that you’re actually interested in (these bits would be your ‘library’). The methods I’ve seen do this by attaching something to the mRNA molecules that we can take advantage of later. For scRNA-seq we are interested in the transcriptome (this is the set of RNA thingamajigs in the cell). Single-Cell Sequencing Workflow: Critical Steps and Considerations (2019) lists a few library preparation techniques for the transcriptome:\n\n\nFull-length RNA-seq\nmRNA end-tag amplification\nTargeted panels\n\nTargeted towards measuring specific things\n\nIR-seq\n\nSpecifically used for B and T cells.\n\n\n\nThese are important for me to understand so I’ll definitely be delving into this topic deeper in the future.\n\n\n\nWe’ve now isolated our cells and grabbed/tagged the bits that we’re interested in. Now, we want to actually be able to learn about the mRNA that we’ve measured. To do this, we need to sequence it.\n\n\nOne important concept for sequencing is the Flow Cell. Intuitively, the flow cell is a sticky plate that will grab the mRNA. An Introduction to Next-Generation Sequencing Technology (2017) defines them as the following:\n\nFlow Cell: A glass slide with one, two, or eight physically separated lanes, depending on the instrument platform. Each lane is coated with a lawn of surface bound, adapter-complimentary oligos. A single library or a pool of up to 96 multiplexed libraries can be run per lane, depending on application parameters.\n– Illumina handbook on next generation sequencing (An Introduction to Next-Generation Sequencing Technology 2017)\n\nAn oligo is a short strand of synthetic DNA (“What Is an Oligo?” 2019). These are the “sticky bits”. Multiplexing is the process of sequencing multiple samples at a time; this can be useful as sequencing produces a lot of data, more than may be necessary for a single project on its own (“NGS Considerations: Coverage, Read Length, Multiplexing,” n.d.). This can be done by attaching molecular barcodes to the prepared cDNA to indicate the original sample from which the cDNA hails.\n\n\nThe flow cell definition given by Illumina is specifically tuned to their flow cells - this may have been obvious due to the use of specific numbers like “96”.\n\n\nTangential Observation\n\nSurprisingly, though, the competitor company Oxford Nanopore also uses this number. I assume this is due to some chemical feature of the bardcodes, but it probably isn’t as simple as that since I know you can have more than 96 UMIs which I thought would be a similar process…\n\n Illumina uses a Sequencing by Synthesis approach; we’ll look at another approach, Nanopore Sequencing, later. During Illumina’s library preparation phase they convert the RNA to cDNA.\n\n\n\nExample of a patterned flow cell\n\n\nThe above diagram is that of a 2D slice of a Patterned Flow Cell. These differ from Nonpatterned Flow Cells in the use of nanowells (little valleys in the cell) to ideally keep fragments of DNA from binding to nearby oligos. Patterned flow cells are a more recent innovation, and for a brief overview of the differences you can read “Calculating Percent Passing Filter for Patterned and Nonpatterned Flow Cells” (2017) and Wingett (2017).\nThe cDNA created during library preparation is added onto the flow cell. The strands of cDNA (reads) will bind to the oligos, and then start multiplying (“bridge amplification”) so that duplicates of the read will be bound to nearby oligos. For patterned flow cells, this should mean that the nanowells are full of copies of the same read - for unpatterned flow cells the clusters are more chaotic.\nAfter you’ve prepared your flow cell, you’ll plug it into a sequencer to read the base pairs. These use chemical tricks to cause each base pair in a read to let out a flash of a specific color. The sequence and color of these flashes will inform the sequencer of what the base pair sequence is. After doing this, you’ll have raw data on the contents of each read, likely in the bcl file format (bcl is the output for Illumina sequencers).\n\n\n\nWhile most of this blog has focused on Illumina, Oxford Nanopore is definitely worth talking about. They use Nanopore Sequencing instead of Sequencing by Synthesis. A brief comparison of the two companines is given by “NGS Platforms: Illumina Vs Oxford Nanopore” (2022).\n\n\n¿cDNA?\n\nIt is possible to directly use RNA, instead of cDNA, depending on what is done at the library preparation stage. I’ll assume we use cDNA here. It would make an interesting blog post, I think, to delve into the intricacies as to what is going on and why we should care about cDNA vs RNA.\n\n\nNanopore sequencing is a newer method; instead of sticking to an oligo, the cDNA passes through a nanopore. To do this, the cDNA has a motor protein attached to it during the library preparation stage. The act of passing through the nanopore creates a detectable electrical signal that is dependent on the bases in the cDNA. By measuring this signal, we can sequence the molecule.\n\n\n\nNanopore sequencing. The cDNA will pass through the nanopore as it gets sequenced. The tether will grab on to the motor protein to accomplish this. (“Product Brochure” 2022)\n\n\nOne interesting advantage of nanopore sequencing is the ability to detect modified bases (which I didn’t know were a thing!) (“Delivering the Future of Genomic Pathogen Surveillance” 2022). Basically, the structure that makes up your G, T, A, C, U nucleic acid bases can actually get modified in certain ways, turning them into different sub-molecules that may affect gene expression.\nOxford Nanopore outputs FAST5 files, a type of HDF5 file. These contain the raw electrical signals the nanopores measured. One can then perform basecalling to determine the sequence of bases corresponding to the signals. Due to the aforementioned detectability of modified bases, these raw electrical signals can have value rather than just looking at an end product of everything converted to G/T/A/C/U (Su 2019).\n\n\n\nFlow cells have two key measures (besides data quality); the amount of reads and the read length. Read counts can be in the hundreds of millions. Read lengths may be much smaller; the flow cells paired with the Illumina NextSeq 550 can only have reads as long as 150 base pairs on average. Oxford Nanopore (and in general any nanopore method) can have unbounded read lengths. Longer reads are desirable from the perspective of reconstructing larger sequences, as it is easier to determine if two segments have a significant overlap.\n\n\n\nMy theory as to why it’s called “depth”\n\n\nAn important concept is coverage, or the amount of times a gene has a read associated with it. Higher coverage is better as it allows us to piece together the gene more accurately and weed out incorrect bases. This is also called sequence depth. Deep sequencing is important for detecting rare genes. This can be affected by the steps done during library preparation; immune cells, which undergo VDJ recombination - in short, each cell has its own unique markers that need to be accounted for (“NGS Considerations: Coverage, Read Length, Multiplexing,” n.d.)\nFor single cell applications depth refers to the amount of reads per cell instead of the reads per base pair measure used for bulk sequencing. When cell populations are more homogenous, the depth should be larger as false overlaps will be more likely.\nFinally, there’s the decision of whether to use paired-end or single-end sequencing. DNA and RNA are linear structures with two different ends - the 5’ and 3’ ends (“5-prime” and “3-prime”). By reading from both the ends, we can better find errors as well as increase the read length (intuitively: instead of reading n base pairs in one direction, you can read 2n total pairs with n in each direction). These advantages decrease when you have UMIs (unique molecular identifiers) or other feature you can take advantage of (such as VDJs), but that is out of scope for this blog post. (“NGS Considerations: Coverage, Read Length, Multiplexing,” n.d.) The advantages are not completely nullified, as single-end sequencing cannot detect certain types of errors (such as “indel” errors).

    "text": "Boulders in Valleys is a puzzle I enjoy creating. It is also a puzzle I enjoy solving. This post is all about solving techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple rules to get a beginner started.\n\n\nThese are four basic techniques to get started. Don’t be intimidated by the variable names, if you see them in practice it’ll make sense.\nThe first pattern should be straightforward; a zero can’t roll anywhere, so it has to sit perched exactly where it is. The xs are used to support the boulder to prevent it rolling off a corner.\nThe second pattern requires a bit more thinking, but if \\(m\\neq n+1\\) then, if it could fall straight down, it would be forced to follow the exact trajectory of \\(n\\), just from 1 higher - i.e. its deepest depth would be \\(n+1\\), a contradiction.\nFor the third pattern, we know that \\(q\\) needs to roll but it can’t roll left or straight down; hence it needs to roll right. We can mark the place it has rolled to with \\(r-1\\), which can prove useful when the puzzle is difficult.\nThe fourth pattern is similar to the second and third in reasoning; if \\(n\\) rolled left, it would be forced to follow \\(p\\)’s deepest trajectory. As \\(p &gt; n\\), this is a contradiction.\n\n\n\nTo take your solving skills to the next step, you should learn some more advanced patterns. In this section, a thick dashed line represents that we are “conditioning” on an edge. That is, we ask ourselves “what happens if this edge is filled in, and what happens if it is crossed out?”. The goal is to find a contradiction down one of the paths, proving that it must be one way or the other.\n\n\n\nThe Elbow Pattern\n\n\nWe can see that, if there is an edge to the left of the 1, the 1 would fall too far. Hence we can arrive at the “elbow” shape shown on the right. This is quite a nice pattern in that it immediately gives you a lot of information about the board; 5 xs and three edges is nothing to scoff at!\n\n\n\nThe Drop Pattern\n\n\nIf a boulder is sandwiched between two same-direction-but-deeper boulders, then we know that the boulder has to fall straight down to prevent merging its trajectory with one of the adjacent boulders.\n\n\n\nThe Corner Pattern\n\n\nThe corner pattern is harder to derive, but also very useful. We can follow a chain of logic to show that there are only two possible local solutions to the pattern. This gives us two xs and two edges, plus we know that the square marked by the diagonal dashed line either bends outwards or inwards. This is also a good pattern to have in your toolkit.\n\n\n\nThe Resting Place Pattern\n\n\nI won’t go through how to derive this pattern, as it’s a straightforward application of the resting place rule descriped in the Advanced Techniques section.\n\n\n\nBoundary Conditions\n\n\nThe next trick is not a pattern, but an observation - since the grid has to be partitioned in two, if you already touch the boundary in two places you know you cannot touch it in any other place. This can give you quite a few xs that are useful for near-boundary logics.\n\n\n\nPhantom Boulders\n\n\nThe next trick is something that was touched upon in the beginner’s section; if you know a boulder has to fall one way, it can be useful to mark that cell with the new boulder’s information. The red cell is an implied boulder of depth 1, due to the fall path of the 3. As an example of how this might be useful, the grey edges show deductions that can be made using the phantom boulder and the corner pattern.\n\n\n\nThe Staircase of Death\n\n\nIn certain situations you can create a staircase of death. If the 5↓ rolls to the right, then it will trigger an cascade that can only be stopped by intersection with the grid boundary. If it would not touch the grid boundary at the right distance, then it produces an invalid configuration and can be ruled out - this forces the 5↓ to roll left and the 5→ to fall right.\n\n\n\nAdvanced techniques can be very powerful, but require a deeper understanding of how Boulders in Valleys works. I’m sure there are some other fundamental concepts that would qualify for being listed here, but that I don’t currently know as I’m still learning myself.\n\n\n\nThe No-Traversal Rule\n\n\nThe “no-traversals” rule comes from a simple observation - no edge can cross the path of a falling boulder. If it does, then the boulder would either stop or roll to the side, thus changing its path. In the left image, we can see a possible path for the boulder to take. However, that would separate the two edges. Since the solution has to be connected, we know it cannot take this path! Thus, we can update our possible paths for the boulder (blue background) by taking this into account.\n\n\n\nAnother use of the no-traversals rule\n\n\nIn this case, we can work out that the boulder falls straight down - if there were anything to its left deflecting it to the right, it would be stuck on the wrong side of the trajectory.\n\n\n\nThe Resting Place Rule\n\n\nEvery boulder n↓ needs to have a resting place exactly \\(n\\) cells below it. Suppose the resting place were over the 0s, then we’d have a clear contradiction as it’d be resting on a corner. Hence it has to rest on the dashed line. This is the resting place rule. Note that a resting place is not just a horizontal edge, but a horizontal edge with two xs beneath it.\n\n\n\nDiagonal Propagations. Starting with a diagonal deduced (dashed line) and a well-placed 1↓, we can propagate the diagonal. The final deduction is in the bottom right.\n\n\nAs we saw from the corner rule, we can sometimes get a “diagonal” deduced, saying that “either all edges on one side of the diagonal are filled in, or all edges on the other side are filled in”. Some things can extend this chain, such as a 1↓ in the right place. Note that this extension has a minor flaw in that the diagonal is not “perfect” - one of the conditions allows a third edge on the diagonal to form a ‘u’ shape to catch the 1↓. However, if we kept on adding 1↓s to the up-right of the previous 1↓, we could continue to propagate this logic."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Have you ever wanted a function that grows faster than a polynomial but slower than an exponential? It’s a fun challenge to try for yourself. Here’s an example (but be warned, this is the last time I’ll spoiler tag something).\n\n\nExample\n\n\\[e^{\\ln(x)^2}\\]\n\nIt’s clear that this grows sub-exponentially, as \\(\\ln(x) &lt; x\\), but after some thought, it still wasn’t clear to me that this would grow faster than a polynomial (based on intuition alone). The related function \\(e^{\\ln(x)}\\) grows linearly, so a priori couldn’t this one grow quadratically? If the brackets were another way (\\((e^{\\ln(x)})^2\\)) then it would. A good rule of thumb for exponentials is that brackets starting from the right grow faster, so intuitively we can argue super-quadratic growth - but super-polynomial? That needs more justification.\nTo see why it is super-polynomial, note the following:\n\\[e^{\\ln(x)^2} = e^{\\ln(x)\\ln(x)} = x^{\\ln(x)}\\]\nSo obviously the exponent of \\(\\ln(x)\\) eventually surpasses any constant exponent \\(c\\). Didn’t expect that, did you? Well, maybe you did, but I didn’t!\nI like this function for a few reasons:\n\nIt’s a cool example of what are called Quasi-Polynomial Functions, i.e. those of the form \\(\\exp(\\mathrm{polynomial}(\\log x))\\), which as super-polynomial but sub-exponential.\nIt shows why such functions, despite being sub-exponential, are intractable (in the algorithmic runtime sense).\n\nI’ll elaborate on the second point. When does our quasi-polynomial surpass a polynomial of degree \\(c\\)? Well, \\(x^{\\ln(x)} &gt; x^c \\iff \\ln(x) &gt; 2 \\iff x &gt; e^c\\). At first glance, this seems good - it takes exponentially large \\(x\\) to surpass a polynomial of fixed size. However, polynomials start becoming intractable in practice for a low value of \\(c\\) - let’s say \\(c=5\\), since every time I’ve used an algorithm with a quintic runtime I’ve regretted it. This just requires \\(x=149\\) for our quasi-polynomial to surpass it, quite a low value!\nDespite this, it’s clearly only “on the edge of intractable”. If we instead claimed \\(c=10\\) was the limit of tractability, we are tractable until \\(x=22027\\). Its tractability is really only held back by the fact that polynomials become intractable at low exponents.\n\n\n\\(e^{\\ln(x)^2}\\) was very briefly my favorite function, but it is not currently my favorite function. Rather, that is this:\n\\[x^{\\ln\\ln(x)}\\]\nIt’s still super-polynomial/sub-exponential (and is also “sub-quasi-polynomial”). It is also quite tractable as far as runtimes go - a \\(c=5\\) tractability cutoff only occurs when \\(x=e^{e^5} &gt; 10^{64}\\). This is more than the number of atoms in the Earth (\\(\\sim 10^{50}\\)), so if you have to deal with a problem that large, you’re already in trouble even with a linear-time algorithm. You need a doubly exponentially large input before things become intractable!\nThat’s certainly part of the reason why I like it; it is a “natural technically intractable tractable function” (which is a very fun phrase to say!). However, there’s another reason, which connects it with my childhood love of tetration:\n\\[x^{\\ln\\ln(x)} = e^{\\ln(x)\\ln\\ln(x)} = \\ln(x)^{\\ln(x)} = \\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 2\\]\nNot only is the identity \\(x^{\\ln\\ln(x)} = \\ln(x)^{\\ln(x)}\\) pleasing, but its slow growth is quite surprising in light of its tetrational nature. Intuitively, I’d have thought through the growth rate of \\(\\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 2\\) as follows:\n\n\\(x\\uparrow\\uparrow 2\\) grows very very fast; it’s the beginning stage of tetration, after all!\n\\(\\ln(x)\\) grows exponentially slow, so \\(\\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 2\\) will be slower than \\(x\\uparrow\\uparrow 2\\), but still fast-growing (because tetration &gt;&gt; exponentiation, exponential slowness can’t bring it down that much.\n\nHowever, this intuition is wrong - the exponential slowness of \\(\\ln(x)\\) is enough to bring it down to something effectively polynomial.\n\n\n\nBoth functions considered so far have been of the form \\(x^{\\ln^n(x)}\\). Technically, \\(x^{\\ln^n(x)}\\) grows faster than any polynomial, but we’ve already seen that (when restricting to human scales) for \\(n\\geq 2\\) it in practice does not. If \\(n=3\\), this function will not beat even a quadratic until about \\(x=10^{703}\\). In fact, it’s easy to see that, as \\(n\\) increases, the intractability threshold recedes away from us tetrationally.\nWe also have the generalized identity, which is sadly only interesting for \\(n=2\\):\n\\[x^{\\ln^n(x)} = e^{\\ln(x)\\ln^n(x)} = \\left(\\ln^{n-1}(x)\\right)^{\\ln(x)}\\]\nIn general, any function \\(x^{f(x)} = e^{\\ln(x)f(x)}\\), for unbounded \\(f\\), is super-polynomial. If \\(f(x) &lt;&lt; \\frac{x}{\\ln(x)}\\) then it will also be sub-exponential.

    "text": "\\(e^{\\ln(x)^2}\\) was very briefly my favorite function, but it is not currently my favorite function. Rather, that is this:\n\\[x^{\\ln\\ln(x)}\\]\nIt’s still super-polynomial/sub-exponential (and is also “sub-quasi-polynomial”). It is also quite tractable as far as runtimes go - a \\(c=5\\) tractability cutoff only occurs when \\(x=e^{e^5} &gt; 10^{64}\\). This is more than the number of atoms in the Earth (\\(\\sim 10^{50}\\)), so if you have to deal with a problem that large, you’re already in trouble even with a linear-time algorithm. You need a doubly exponentially large input before things become intractable!\nThat’s certainly part of the reason why I like it; it is a “natural technically intractable tractable function” (which is a very fun phrase to say!). However, there’s another reason, which connects it with my childhood love of tetration:\n\\[x^{\\ln\\ln(x)} = e^{\\ln(x)\\ln\\ln(x)} = \\ln(x)^{\\ln(x)} = \\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 2\\]\nNot only is the identity \\(x^{\\ln\\ln(x)} = \\ln(x)^{\\ln(x)}\\) pleasing, but its slow growth is quite surprising in light of its tetrational nature. Intuitively, I’d have thought through the growth rate of \\(\\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 2\\) as follows:\n\n\\(x\\uparrow\\uparrow 2\\) grows very very fast; it’s the beginning stage of tetration, after all!\n\\(\\ln(x)\\) grows exponentially slow, so \\(\\ln(x)\\uparrow\\uparrow 2\\) will be slower than \\(x\\uparrow\\uparrow 2\\), but still fast-growing (because tetration &gt;&gt; exponentiation, exponential slowness can’t bring it down that much.\n\nHowever, this intuition is wrong - the exponential slowness of \\(\\ln(x)\\) is enough to bring it down to something effectively polynomial."

In fact, it’s easy to see that, as \\(n\\) increases, the intractability threshold recedes away from us tetrationally.\nWe also have the generalized identity, which is sadly only interesting for \\(n=2\\):\n\\[x^{\\ln^n(x)} = e^{\\ln(x)\\ln^n(x)} = \\left(\\ln^{n-1}(x)\\right)^{\\ln(x)}\\]\nIn general, any function \\(x^{f(x)} = e^{\\ln(x)f(x)}\\), for unbounded \\(f\\), is super-polynomial.

    "text": "Sam inspired me to make a blog, so here it is. The goal of this blog is to document random problems I encounter over the course of the PhD, since often I end up encountering the same problem multiple times but forget how to solve it.\n\n\nThe first problem I encountered, albeit not a recurring one, is how to make a blog. Sam made me aware of Jekyll but I wanted to find a Jupyter-based solution since I do (almost) all of my work in JupyterLab. This led me to nbdev. nbdev does many things, it seems, one of which is to allow you to compile .ipynb files into a blog.\n\n\nI then created two new conda environments, Jupyter-nbdev and Blog-nbdev: the first environment will be for the nbdev-empowered JupyterLab editor, and the second environment will be the specific kernel I’ll use with the editor.\nSince I’ll have multiple environments open, as well as launching JupyterLab from a terminal and handling GitHub push/pulls to publish the blog, I created a terminal setup that looks like this:\n\n\n\nCustomized Terminal\n\n\nI’ll share the commands I used to set this up, with a comment at the start indicating which terminal tab the commands should be run in.\n# (Jupyter-nbdev)\nconda create -n Jupyter-nbdev\nconda activate Jupyter-nbdev\n\nconda install conda-forge::python=3.9 fastai::nbdev=2.3.9 conda-forge::jupyterlab=3.5.1 conda-forge::nb_conda_kernels=2.3.1\nI chose Python 3.9 because in the past bumping up to 3.10 has caused some packages to not be available. I found the specific versions for other packages by running search commands and picking the most recent version:\n# (Jupyter-nbdev)\nconda search conda-forge::nbdev\nconda search fastai::nbdev\nconda search conda-forge::jupyterlab\nconda search conda-forge::nb_conda_kernels\nI would have preferred to install nbdev from conda-forge (since in the past I’ve had problems from mixing channels) but the only version available was a decent bit behind the fastai channel, and I’m early in the process so it wouldn’t be a big deal if I needed to start over due to channel-mixing woes.\n# (Blog-nbdev)\nconda create -n Blog-nbdev\nconda activate Blog-nbdev\nconda install conda-forge::python=3.9 fastai::nbdev=2.3.9 conda-forge::ipykernel=6.19.2\nipykernel and nb_conda_kernels are used to allow the Jupyter-nbdev JupyterLab to find the Blog-nbdev kernel. From there, I launched JupyterLab:\n# (JupyterLab)\nconda activate Jupyter-nbdev\njupyter lab\n\n\n\nI followed the steps here. In short: create a new public repository with no ReadMe or other file, but with the ‘description’ field filled in. Then, go to the directory that you want to create your repo in in your terminal:\n# (GitHub)\nconda activate Blog-nbdev\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/NAME_OF_YOUR_REPO.git\ncd NAME_OF_YOUR_REPO\nnbdev_new\nThe last command tells nbdev to fill out the repository with the template for your blog. I got the following output from nbdev_new:\n# Output of (GitHub)\n/Users/baileyandrew/opt/anaconda3/envs/Blog-nbdev/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ghapi/core.py:101: UserWarning: Neither GITHUB_TOKEN nor GITHUB_JWT_TOKEN found: running as unauthenticated\n  else: warn('Neither GITHUB_TOKEN nor GITHUB_JWT_TOKEN found: running as unauthenticated')\nrepo = Blog # Automatically inferred from git\nbranch = main # Automatically inferred from git\nuser = BaileyAndrew # Automatically inferred from git\nauthor = Bailey Andrew # Automatically inferred from git\nauthor_email = MY_EMAIL@cool-emails.com # Automatically inferred from git\ndescription = A blog. # Automatically inferred from git\nsettings.ini created.\n/bin/sh: quarto: command not found\nThe output looks a little warning-y, but let’s continue for now:\n# (GitHub)\ngit add .\ngit commit -m 'Created Blog'\ngit push\n\n# Output\n! [remote rejected] main -&gt; main (refusing to allow a Personal Access Token to create or update workflow .github/workflows/deploy.yaml without workflow scope)\nThe push command fails; the error message seems related to the warning I got previously. The problem seems to be that I only ever create GitHub tokens with ‘repo’ permissions, not ‘workflow’ permissions, but nbdev uses the workflow feature to prepare the website. This is easy to fix: on GitHub, click on your profile and go to ‘settings’, then ‘developer settings’, ‘personal access tokens’, and finally ‘tokens (classic)’. You can either create a new token, or update an existing one - just make sure to add the ‘workflow’ permissions.\nOnce you’ve pushed, go into settings on GitHub to set the branch to be gh-pages: \nFinally, run the following to allow nbdev to trigger workflows:\n# (GitHub)\nnbdev_install_hooks\nNow, whenever you push to main, a workflow will automatically trigger that will generate the html/css/js for your website and put it in the gh-pages branch. (I do not know if pushing to other branches would trigger this as well).\n\n\n\nWhen you’re ready to start writing blog posts, go into the nbs folder and create a new .ipynb with the kernel Python [conda env:Blog-nbdev]. (If it’s not in the nbs folder, it won’t appear in the blog). There are already two examples, index.ipynb and 00_core.ipynb - index.ipynb probably fills some special role so don’t mess with it, but you can delete 00_core.ipynb.\nImportantly, your first cell should be a markdown cell with just a top-level header:\n# Top-level header\nThe name of the header will be the name of the blog post in the generated website (and the name of the file will be the name of the url to that post). If you have anything else in the first cell, it will probably be cut off.

Running nbdev_preview was quite helpful in debugging the issues, as it previews your website and updates automatically!"
