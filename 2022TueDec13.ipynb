    "He showed me the Jekyll template, but I might want to see if I can manage it using JupyterLab as I do most of my work in that environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started searching for a JupyterLab method and found this post https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-20-nb2md.html.  The blog points out that interactive widgets won't show up in the blog if done through Jupyter, which is unfortunate because I might like to make them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had seen nbdev mentioned before, which is why I looked into it instead of the other suggestion fast_template.  I first created the conda environment for nbdev-able JupyterLab.  I keep my JupyterLab installations in their own environment separate from the kernel environments as I find that to be the most organized way of working with them.  My current JupyterLab environments are just a standard JupyterLab, an SOS Notebook (story for another time, but I recommend it if you work in multiple languages frequently), and now this.\n",

    "Surprisingly there is only one version; typically there are more.  The official nbdev directions recommend installing from the fastai channel (`conda search fastai::nbdev`), which has multiple versions to choose from going up to 2.3.9.  I'm reluctant to use the fastai channel because I've had issues in the past with mixing channels - but, since I'm so early in the process I'll go for it.  Worst case scenario I'll kill this environment and start from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll install it along with Python 3.9 - I chose 3.9 because in the past not every library I've wanted has been compatible with 3.10, but I haven't encountered any conflicts with 3.9 yet.  I don't really need its features so I could be more conservative if needed.\n",

    "I then remember I still need to install JupyterLab - so much for a one-liner.  I `conda search` it to determine the most recent version, and then install.  I like being explicit with my versioning, so that `conda env export --from-history` is more consistent across time.\n",
